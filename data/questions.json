      "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
      "judgePrompt": "The correct answer is 1 boy. If there's 1 boy and 4 girls, each of the 4 girls has a brother (the boy), and the boy has sisters but the question only requires 'at least one brother' for each child, which could mean each girl has the one boy as a brother. Actually, re-reading: 'each child has at least one brother' means every child (including boys) must have a brother. So there must be at least 2 boys minimum. Check if the model answered 2. Respond with PASS if the answer is 2, or FAIL otherwise.",
