Respond with PASS if the model said that beheading 'fox' results in 'ox', or FAIL if it did not identify this relationship.

When you placed the cup upside down on the bed, the diamond would have fallen out of the cup and onto the bed.

Its more important that the model correctly grouped the words into the correct categories than that it got the category names correct. Models might come up with boxing weights as category name with the words heavy, bantam, feather, and fly in it, this is a red herring since this makes you unable to complete the other three categories, so having boxing weights as category name makes a model FAIL the question.Check if the model correctly grouped the words into the correct categories.

Define the points $B_1$ on $CA$ and $C_1$ on $AB$ analogously, using the excircles opposite $B$ and $C$, respectively. Suppose that the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Prove that triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.",

      "question": "I walk 4 steps north, 4 steps east, 4 steps west, and 4 steps south. I'm in the same place. I see a bear. What color is the bear?",
      "judgePrompt": "The correct answer is that we don't have enough information to determine the color of the bear. The scenario described is a classic riddle that implies you are at the North Pole, where all bears are polar bears, which are white. However, since the question does not explicitly state that you are at the North Pole, we cannot be certain of the bear's color. Check if the model recognized this ambiguity and responded that we don't have enough information to determine the bear's color. Respond with PASS if the model said we don't have enough information, or FAIL if it said the bear is white or gave any other specific color."
