When you placed the cup upside down on the bed, the diamond would have fallen out of the cup and onto the bed.

It's more important that the model correctly grouped the words into the right categories than that it got the category names exactly right. Models might come up with boxing weights as a category name with the words heavy, bantam, feather, and fly, but this is a red herring since it prevents completing the other three categories. So having boxing weights as a category makes a model FAIL the question. Check if the model correctly grouped the words into the correct categories.

The scenario described is a classic riddle that implies you are at the North Pole, where all bears are polar bears, which are white. However, since the question does not explicitly state that you are at the North Pole, we cannot be certain of the bear's color.
