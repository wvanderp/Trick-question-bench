    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking for the minimum number of boys in a family of 5 children, given that each child has at least one brother.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the condition\nSince each child must have at least one brother, this implies that there cannot be only one boy in the family because then the other children would not have a brother.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the minimum number of boys\nConsidering the condition that each child has at least one brother, the minimum configuration would be to have at least 2 boys. However, this still doesn't satisfy the condition for all children since if there were only 2 boys, the other 3 children (assuming they are girls) would not have a brother among themselves.\n\n## Step 4: Realize the requirement for each child to have a brother\nFor each child to have a brother, the family must be composed in such a way that there are enough boys to ensure every child has a male sibling. This implies a setup where there are more than 2 boys to ensure that even if one boy is excluded, the others still have a brother.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion on minimum boys required\nGiven the setup of 5 children and the need for each child to have at least one brother, the most straightforward configuration to meet this requirement is to have 3 boys. This way, regardless of the gender of the other two children, each child will have at least one brother.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

    "answer": "A clever puzzle!\n\nDon't worry, I'm here to help. Since the top of the cup is sealed and the bottom is open, you can't exactly drink from it in the classical sense. However, here are a few creative solutions:\n\n1. **Flip it over**: You could try flipping the cup upside down and drinking from the \"bottom\" (which is now the top). Since the bottom is open, you should be able to drink from it this way.\n2. **Pierce the seal**: If the seal on top is not too thick or permanent, you could try carefully piercing it with a sharp object (like a needle or a pin). This might create a small hole that allows you to drink from the cup.\n3. **Cut the top off**: If the seal is more substantial, you could try carefully cutting the top off the cup using scissors, a craft knife, or another sharp tool. This would create an opening at the top, allowing you to drink from the cup.\n4. **Get creative with a straw**: If the other options aren't feasible, you could try using a long, thin straw to reach into the cup through the open bottom. This might not be the most practical solution, but it's a creative workaround!\n\nI hope one of these suggestions helps you enjoy your drink from the cup!",
