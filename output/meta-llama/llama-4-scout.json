    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that in a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. This means that there must be at least one boy in the family because if all children were girls, none of them would have a brother.\n\n## 2: Determine the minimum number of boys\nSince each child must have at least one brother, the minimum configuration to satisfy this condition would be to have one boy and four girls. However, if there is only one boy, he would have four sisters but no brothers, which violates the condition that each child has at least one brother.\n\n## 3: Find the configuration that satisfies the condition\nTo satisfy the condition that each child has at least one brother, we need to ensure that there are enough boys so that every child, regardless of gender, has at least one brother. If there are two boys, each of the two boys has one brother (the other boy), and each of the three girls has two brothers. This configuration satisfies the condition.\n\n## 4: Confirm the minimum number of boys\nWith two boys and three girls, every child in the family has at least one brother. The two boys each have one brother, and the three girls each have two brothers. Therefore, the minimum number of boys required for each child to have at least one brother is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

If you know the encoding method, you can use a tool or library to decode it.\n\n2. **Look for Patterns**: Sometimes, strings like these might have patterns or specific sequences that can give clues about their origin or meaning.\n\n3. **Context is Key**: Understanding the context in which you encountered this string can be crucial. Was it from a game, a puzzle, an error message, or a communication with someone?\n\n4. **Use Decoding Tools or Websites**: There are online tools and communities (like forums or chat rooms focused on cryptography) where you can paste the string to see if anyone can help you decode it.\n\n5. **Be Cautious**: If the string came from an untrusted source, be cautious about trying to decode or execute it, as it could potentially contain malicious content.\n\nIf you have any more details or if there's a specific question you have regarding this string, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you!",

    "answer": "To solve this, let's denote the cost of the ball as \\(x\\) dollars. Since the bat costs $2 more than the ball, the bat's cost can be represented as \\(x + 2\\) dollars.\n\nThe total cost for both the bat and the ball together is $3.30. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[x + (x + 2) = 3.30\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[2x + 2 = 3.30\\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[2x = 1.30\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[x = 0.65\\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.65. Since the bat costs $2 more than the ball:\n\n\\[x + 2 = 0.65 + 2 = 2.65\\]\n\nTherefore, the ball costs $0.65 and the bat costs $2.65. \n\nYou can verify this by adding their costs: $0.65 (ball) + $2.65 (bat) = $3.30.",

    "answer": "To drink from a cup that has a sealed top and is open at the bottom, you'll need to find a way to create a vacuum or pressure difference that allows the liquid to flow out of the top. Here are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. **Cut the bottom off**: If you have a sharp object, you can carefully cut off the bottom of the cup, making sure not to cut yourself. This will allow you to drink from the top without any issues.\n2. **Make a hole in the bottom**: If you don't want to cut the cup, you can try making a small hole in the bottom using a sharp object like a pin or a needle. This will allow air to enter the cup and create a pressure difference that might allow you to drink from the top.\n3. **Use a straw**: If you have a straw, you can insert it through the sealed top of the cup and drink from the straw. This way, you won't have to open the cup.\n4. **Seal the top and turn it upside down**: If you seal the top of the cup with your hand or a piece of tape, you can turn the cup upside down and drink from the \"bottom\" (which is now the top). Be careful not to spill!\n5. **Ask your friend to help**: If none of the above solutions work, you can always ask your friend who gave you the cup to help you figure out a way to drink from it. Maybe they have a clever solution!\n\nRemember to be careful when handling sharp objects, and make sure the cup is clean and safe to use.",

Define the points $B_1$ on $CA$ and $C_1$ on $AB$ analogously, using the excircles opposite $B$ and $C$, respectively. Suppose that the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Prove that triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understanding the given problem and notations\nThe problem involves a triangle $ABC$ and the construction of points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ based on the excircles of the triangle. The excircle opposite vertex $A$ is tangent to side $BC$ at $A_1$, and similarly, $B_1$ and $C_1$ are defined for the other vertices. We need to prove that if the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$, then triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.\n\n## 2: Recalling relevant geometric properties\nRecall that the excircles of a triangle are the circles tangent to one side of the triangle and to the extensions of the other two sides. The points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ are the points of tangency of these excircles with the sides of the triangle.\n\n## 3: Identifying key geometric relationships\nLet $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC$, and $r$ be the inradius. The points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ divide the sides of the triangle into segments that can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and the inradius.\n\n## 4: Expressing $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ in vector form\nWe can express the position vectors of $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ in terms of the position vectors of $A$, $B$, and $C$. For example, $\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}}{2}$, and similarly for $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{c}_1$, but we need to adjust according to the actual formula which involves the lengths of the sides and the semiperimeter.\n\n## 5: Finding the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$\nThe circumcentre $O'$ of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ can be found using the formula for the circumcentre, but given that it lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, we have a specific condition.\n\n## 6: Condition for $O'$ to lie on the circumcircle of $ABC$\nThe condition that $O'$ lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$ implies that the distance from $O'$ to any vertex of $ABC$ is equal, as this distance is the circumradius of triangle $ABC$.\n\n## 7: Utilizing complex numbers for representation\nLet's represent the vertices as complex numbers $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$. Then, $A_1 = \\frac{b+c-a}{2}$, $B_1 = \\frac{a+c-b}{2}$, and $C_1 = \\frac{a+b-c}{2}$. The circumcentre $O'$ of $A_1B_1C_1$ can be expressed in terms of these.\n\n## 8: Deriving the relationship for $O'$\nBy expressing $O'$ in terms of $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$ and using the fact that it lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, we can derive conditions on $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$.\n\n## 9: Applying the condition for a right-angled triangle\nA triangle is right-angled if the dot product of two of its sides is zero (or equivalently, if the Pythagorean theorem holds). We need to show that this condition follows from the given geometric conditions.\n\n## 10: Conclusion\nGiven that $O'$ lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, and using properties of complex numbers and geometry, we aim to show that $ABC$ must be a right triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{ABC}$",

    "answer": "Given that there were 100 male inmates at the beginning of the year and 99 inmates at the end of the year, with no deaths due to natural causes or accidents, and no prisoners being released, the most logical conclusion is that one inmate was killed by another (or more than one, but at least one). \n\nThe presence of rival gangs that hate and often murder each other within the prison setting provides a plausible motive for such violence. In a maximum-security prison with a volatile environment where gang rivalries are intense, violence, including murder, is unfortunately a possibility. \n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that the reduction in inmate numbers from 100 to 99 over the course of the year resulted from an act of violence, specifically murder, committed by one or more inmates against another.",
