    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that in a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. This means that there must be at least one boy in the family because if all children were girls, none of them would have a brother.\n\n## 2: Determine the minimum number of boys\nSince each child must have at least one brother, the minimum configuration to satisfy this condition would be to have one boy and four girls. However, if there is only one boy, he would have four sisters but no brothers, which violates the condition that each child has at least one brother.\n\n## 3: Find the configuration that satisfies the condition\nTo satisfy the condition that each child has at least one brother, we need to ensure that there are enough boys so that every child, regardless of gender, has at least one brother. If there are two boys, each of the two boys has one brother (the other boy), and each of the three girls has two brothers. This configuration satisfies the condition.\n\n## 4: Confirm the minimum number of boys\nWith two boys and three girls, every child in the family has at least one brother. The two boys each have one brother, and the three girls each have two brothers. Therefore, the minimum number of boys required for each child to have at least one brother is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

    "question": "If a bat and ball cost $3.30, and the bat costs $2 more than the ball, how much do they cost each?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Define the variables for the cost of the ball and the bat.\nLet's denote the cost of the ball as \\(B\\) and the cost of the bat as \\(T\\). We know that the bat costs $2 more than the ball, so we can express the cost of the bat in terms of the cost of the ball as \\(T = B + 2\\).\n\n## Step 2: Write the equation based on the total cost of the bat and ball.\nThe total cost of the bat and the ball together is $3.30, so we can write the equation as \\(B + T = 3.30\\). Substituting \\(T = B + 2\\) into this equation gives us \\(B + (B + 2) = 3.30\\).\n\n## 3: Solve the equation for the cost of the ball.\nSimplifying the equation \\(B + B + 2 = 3.30\\), we get \\(2B + 2 = 3.30\\). Subtracting 2 from both sides gives \\(2B = 1.30\\). Dividing both sides by 2 yields \\(B = 0.65\\).\n\n## 4: Find the cost of the bat.\nNow that we know the ball costs $0.65, we can find the cost of the bat using \\(T = B + 2\\). So, \\(T = 0.65 + 2 = 2.65\\).\n\n## 5: Verify the solution.\nTo ensure our solution is correct, let's verify that the bat and ball together cost $3.30. The bat costs $2.65 and the ball costs $0.65, so \\(2.65 + 0.65 = 3.30\\), which confirms our solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.65, 2.65}$",

    "question": "In a room of 30 people, what's the probability that at least two do not share a birthday?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the approach\nTo find the probability that at least two people do not share a birthday in a room of 30 people, it's easier to first calculate the probability that all 30 people share the same birthday and then subtract that from 1. However, the direct approach to solve this problem involves understanding that if at least two people do not share a birthday, we are looking for the complement of the event where all people share the same birthday. But to simplify, we'll calculate the probability that no two people share a birthday and use that to find our answer.\n\n## 2: Calculate the probability that no two people share a birthday\nThe total number of days in a year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity) is 365. The first person can have any birthday, so there are 365 possibilities. The second person must have a different birthday, so there are 364 possibilities. The third person must have a different birthday than the first two, so there are 363 possibilities, and so on.\n\n## 3: Apply the formula for the probability of no shared birthdays\nFor 30 people, the probability that no two share a birthday is calculated as:\n\\[ P(\\text{no shared birthdays}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{365 - 29}{365} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{no shared birthdays}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{29} \\frac{365 - i}{365} \\]\n\n## 4: Calculate the probability\nLet's calculate this probability:\n\\[ P(\\text{no shared birthdays}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{336}{365} \\]\nThis product is:\n\\[ P(\\text{no shared birthdays}) = \\frac{365 \\times 364 \\times 363 \\times \\cdots \\times 336}{365^{30}} \\]\n\n## 5: Compute the product\nTo simplify the computation, we can use an approximate calculation or a calculator. The product can be computed or approximated using:\n\\[ P(\\text{no shared birthdays}) \\approx \\frac{365^{30} \\times e^{-\\frac{30 \\times 29}{2 \\times 365}}}{365^{30}} \\]\nHowever, for accuracy, let's proceed with the direct calculation approach or use a known result for this problem.\n\n## 6: Use a known approach for simplification\nA more straightforward approach to solve the original problem is to calculate the probability that all 30 people share the same birthday and subtract it from 1. However, the direct calculation of at least two not sharing a birthday involves considering the complement event properly.\n\n## 7: Calculate using complement rule properly\nThe probability that all people share a birthday is \\((\\frac{1}{365})^{29}\\) since the first person's birthday can be any day, and the rest must match it. But for at least two not sharing, we consider the probability of everyone having a unique birthday:\n\\[ P(\\text{at least two do not share}) = 1 - P(\\text{all share}) \\]\nBut given the nature of the problem, let's focus on the direct calculation for clarity.\n\n## 8: Final calculation\nThe probability that at least two people do not share a birthday can be found by calculating 1 minus the probability that everyone shares a birthday. However, an easier method is to calculate the probability that everyone has a different birthday and recognize that if this is not the case, then at least two people do not share a birthday.\n\n## 9: Execute the final calculation\nUsing the formula for the probability that all birthdays are different:\n\\[ P(\\text{all different}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{336}{365} \\]\nThis can be computed or looked up. For 30 people:\n\\[ P(\\text{all different}) \\approx 0.294 \\]\nSo, the probability that at least two do not share a birthday is:\n\\[ P(\\text{at least two do not share}) = 1 - P(\\text{all share}) \\]\nBut since \\(P(\\text{all share}) = (\\frac{1}{365})^{29}\\) is extremely small, we can approximate:\n\\[ P(\\text{at least two do not share}) \\approx 1 \\]\nGiven the nature of the calculation, let's refine:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that the probability is 1 (or extremely close to it) by recognizing that the event \"at least two people do not share a birthday\" is the complement of \"all 30 people share the same birthday.\" Since the probability of all 30 sharing a birthday is $(\\frac{1}{365})^{29}$, the result is $1 - (\\frac{1}{365})^{29}$, which rounds to 1.

    "question": "You have two ropes, each of which takes exactly 60 minutes to burn completely. However, the ropes burn unevenly, meaning some parts may burn faster or slower than others. You have no other timing device. How can you measure exactly 20 minutes using these two ropes and matches to light them?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Light both ends of one rope and one end of the other rope\nLighting both ends of one rope means it will burn completely in 30 minutes, since it has two ends burning simultaneously, effectively halving the time it takes to burn completely. Lighting one end of the other rope will start its 60-minute burning process.\n\n## 2: Wait for the first rope to burn completely\nWhen the first rope burns completely (after 30 minutes), we know that 30 minutes have passed. At this point, the second rope has been burning for 30 minutes.\n\n## 3: Light the other end of the second rope\nNow, we light the other end of the second rope. Since 30 minutes have already passed and this rope has been burning from one end for 30 minutes, it has 30 minutes of burn time left. By lighting the other end, we again halve the remaining burn time, meaning it will take 15 minutes for the second rope to burn completely from both ends.\n\n## 4: Measure the time elapsed\nWhen the second rope burns completely (after the additional 15 minutes), a total of 30 minutes (from step 2) + 15 minutes (from step 3) = 45 minutes have passed. However, the goal is to measure exactly 20 minutes.\n\n## 5: Correct the approach for measuring 20 minutes\nTo measure exactly 20 minutes, let's correct the approach: Light one end of each rope. When one rope finishes (after 60 minutes), 60 minutes have passed, but we want to utilize the time more efficiently. So, we should light both ends of one rope and one end of the other.\n\n## 6: Execute the corrected approach\n- Light both ends of Rope A and one end of Rope B.\n- Rope A will burn for 30 minutes.\n- When Rope A finishes, light the other end of Rope B.\n\n## 7: Calculate the time for the corrected approach\n- Rope A burns for 30 minutes.\n- By the time Rope A is done, Rope B has been burning for 30 minutes.\n- Then, Rope B has 30 minutes left (since it takes 60 minutes to burn completely and 30 minutes have already passed).\n- Lighting the other end of Rope B will make it burn the remaining 30 minutes in 15 minutes.\n\n## 8: Determine the total time elapsed for 20 minutes measurement\n- 30 minutes (until Rope A is done) + 15 minutes (until Rope B is done after being lit at both ends) = 45 minutes. This approach doesn't directly give us 20 minutes.\n\n## 9: Final approach to measure exactly 20 minutes\n- Light one end of Rope 1 and both ends of Rope 2.\n- When Rope 2 is completely burned (30 minutes), light the other end of Rope 1.\n\n## 10: Calculate the time for the final approach\n- Rope 2 burns for 30 minutes.\n- At this point, Rope 1 has been burning for 30 minutes.\n- The remaining length of Rope 1 will burn for 30 minutes (since it had 60 minutes total burn time and 30 minutes have passed).\n- When Rope 1 is lit at both ends, its remaining 30 minutes of burn time becomes 15 minutes.\n- So, 30 minutes (until Rope 2 is done) + 15 minutes (until Rope 1 finishes burning from both ends) is not the right calculation here; we actually need to consider that when Rope 2 finishes, we have 30 minutes left on Rope 1, and then it takes 10 minutes for the last part of Rope 1 to burn after it's lit from both ends.\n\n## 11: Execute the timing\n- When Rope 2 burns out (30 minutes), Rope 1 has 30 minutes of burn left.\n- Lighting both ends of Rope 1 at this point makes the last 30 minutes of Rope 1 burn in 15 minutes.\n- So, from the start: 30 minutes until Rope 2 is done, and then 15 minutes for Rope 1 to finish, which equals 45 minutes. To get 20 minutes: Reconsider the timing strategy.\n\n## 12: Optimize for 20 minutes\n- Light both ends of Rope 1 (burns in 30 minutes).\n- Light one end of Rope 2.\n- When Rope 1 is done (30 minutes), Rope 2 has burned for 30 minutes, leaving 30 minutes of burn time.\n- Now, light the other end of Rope 2. The 30 minutes left will burn in 15 minutes.\n\n## 13: Calculate the 20-minute mark\nAt the 30-minute mark (when Rope 1 finishes), Rope 2 has 30 minutes left. After lighting the second end of Rope 2, it takes 15 minutes to burn out. So, 30 minutes (Rope 1) + 10 minutes (half of Rope 2’s remaining 20 minutes, since we actually count from the moment Rope 1 finishes and half of the remaining time of Rope 2) is incorrect; correctly, it’s about using the ropes to split time accurately.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",

    "question": "A dead cat is placed into a box along with a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison and a radiation detector. If the radiation detector detects radiation, it will release the poison. The box is opened one day later. What is the probability of the cat being alive?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the setup of the problem\nThe problem describes a thought experiment involving a cat, a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison, and a radiation detector in a box. The radiation detector is set to release the poison if it detects radiation from the nuclear isotope. The cat's fate is tied to whether the isotope decays and emits radiation that is detected.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the nature of the nuclear isotope's decay\nThe nuclear isotope decays randomly according to its half-life. The probability of decay within a given time frame (in this case, one day) can be calculated based on its half-life. However, the specific half-life of the isotope is not given.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the condition for the cat's survival\nThe cat survives if the radiation detector does not detect radiation from the isotope within the day. The detection of radiation leads to the release of the poison, killing the cat.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the probabilistic nature of radioactive decay\nRadioactive decay is a probabilistic process. The probability that an atom decays within a certain time frame is related to its half-life. For a large number of atoms, the decay is predictable on average, but for a single atom or a small number of atoms, the decay is random.\n\n## Step 5: Understand the implications of the thought experiment\nThis thought experiment is a variation of Schrödinger's cat, which illustrates the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics. According to quantum mechanics, until the box is opened and the cat is observed, the cat is both alive and dead (in a superposition of states).\n\n## Step 6: Apply the principles of quantum mechanics to the cat's state\nBefore the box is opened, the cat's state is a superposition of alive and dead. Upon opening the box, the cat's state collapses to either alive or dead.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the probability based on the given information\nThe problem does not specify the half-life of the isotope or the sensitivity of the detector. However, it's implied that we're dealing with a situation where the probability of decay is significant enough to be considered.\n\n## Step 8: Recall the original Schrödinger's cat thought experiment\nIn the original thought experiment, the probability of the cat being alive or dead is 50% if the probability of the radioactive atom decaying (and thus triggering the poison release) is 50% within the given time frame.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the probability of the cat being alive when the box is opened\nGiven that the box is opened one day later, and assuming the isotope has a half-life of approximately one day (to simplify, as the actual half-life isn't specified), there's a 50% chance the isotope has decayed, and thus a 50% chance the cat is dead.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the probability based on the assumption of a 50% chance of decay\nIf we assume a 50% chance of the isotope decaying within one day (which corresponds to a half-life of one day for simplicity), then there's a 50% chance the cat is dead and a 50% chance it's alive upon opening the box.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.5}$",

    "question": "You are in a room with two doors. One is unlocked and leads to freedom, with a large \"exit sign\" above it, the other to certain doom and is therefore locked. There are two guards: one always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You don't know which is which. You can ask one guard one question or just leave. What do you do?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem presents a scenario where there are two doors, one leading to freedom and the other to certain doom. There are also two guards, one who always tells the truth and one who always lies. The goal is to escape by asking one guard one question or by choosing a door.\n\n## 2: Determine the Strategy\nTo solve this, we need to ask a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guard we ask. Since one guard always lies and the other always tells the truth, we must phrase our question in a way that accounts for both possibilities.\n\n## 3: Formulate the Question\nThe key to solving this puzzle is to ask a question that, when answered, will steer us towards the correct door regardless of the guard's nature (truth-teller or liar). A suitable question is: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n## 4: Analyze the Possible Responses\n- If we ask the truth-teller, they will tell us what the liar would say. The liar would point to the door that leads to doom (because they always lie), so the truth-teller will tell us that the liar would say the door to doom is the exit.\n- If we ask the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say. The truth-teller would point to the door to freedom, but the liar will tell us that the truth-teller would say the door to doom is the exit.\n\n## 5: Choose the Door Based on the Response\nIn both cases, if we ask the question formulated, the guard will point to the door that leads to doom. Therefore, we should choose the other door.\n\n## 6: Conclusion\nBy asking the formulated question, we ensure that we get misleading information that leads us to the correct door. Since both guards, when asked the question, will point to the door leading to doom, we simply choose the other door.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{exit}$",

    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nThe farmer can only take one item at a time across the river. The wolf will eat the goat if they are left alone together, and the goat will eat the cabbage if they are left alone together.\n\n## 2: Determine the initial action\nThe farmer starts on one side of the river with the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage. To ensure the goat is not eaten or does not eat the cabbage, the farmer must take the goat across the river first, as taking the wolf or cabbage first would leave the goat vulnerable.\n\n## 3: First crossing - Take the goat across\nThe farmer takes the goat across the river and leaves it on the other side. This side now has the goat, and the original side has the wolf and the cabbage.\n\n## 4: Return to the original side\nThe farmer returns to the original side alone to pick up either the wolf or the cabbage. If he picks up the wolf, he must take it across and leave it with the goat, but then he must take the goat back to the original side to pick up the cabbage, which would leave the goat and wolf together on the original side. So, a better approach is needed.\n\n## 5: Correct the approach - Take the goat across and then the cabbage\nThe farmer takes the goat across and leaves it on the other side. Then, he goes back to the original side and takes the cabbage across, leaving it on the other side with the goat. However, he cannot leave the goat and cabbage together.\n\n## 6: Take the goat back and then the wolf\nThe farmer takes the goat back to the original side (so the goat is now back with the wolf), and then takes the wolf across to the other side, leaving it there with the cabbage.\n\n## 7: Final step - Take the goat across\nFinally, the farmer goes back to the original side and takes the goat across, reuniting it with the wolf and cabbage but ensuring it was not left alone with either.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Goat -> Back -> Cabbage -> Goat -> Back -> Wolf -> Goat}$",

    "question": "I have a 6- and a 12-liter jug. I want to measure exactly 4 liters.",
    "answer": "To measure exactly 4 liters using a 6-liter and a 12-liter jug, follow these steps:\n\n1. Fill the 6-liter jug completely, so you have 6 liters in it.\n2. Pour the 6 liters from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug. Now, the 12-liter jug has 6 liters, and the 6-liter jug is empty.\n3. Fill the 6-liter jug again, so you have 6 liters in it.\n4. Pour from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full. Since the 12-liter jug already has 6 liters, you can only pour 6 liters into it to fill it up, which means you'll pour 6 liters from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug. However, this step was inaccurately described - you actually pour from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full. The 12-liter jug can hold 12 liters, and it already has 6 liters, so it needs 6 more liters to be full. This means you'll pour 6 liters from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug, leaving the 6-liter jug empty and the 12-liter jug full (12 liters).\n   \nCorrecting and continuing from step 3 properly:\n\n3. Fill the 6-liter jug again, so you have 6 liters in it.\n4. Pour from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug. The 12-liter jug already has 6 liters, so it can only take 6 more liters to be full. Pouring 6 liters from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug fills the 12-liter jug (now it has 12 liters) and empties the 6-liter jug.\n\nCorrect Steps:\n1. Fill the 6-liter jug.\n2. Pour into the 12-liter jug (6 liters now in 12-liter, 0 in 6-liter).\n3. Fill the 6-liter jug again.\n4. Pour from the 6-liter into the 12-liter until the 12-liter is full: Since the 12-liter jug only needs 6 liters to be full (it has 6 liters), you pour only what fits, which would actually be that you fill the 12-liter jug and have 0 liters in the 6-liter jug left because it pours all 6 liters into the 12-liter.\n\nThe accurate steps to get 4 liters are:\n1. Fill the 6-liter jug (6 liters in it, 0 in 12-liter).\n2. Pour the 6 liters into the 12-liter jug (0 liters in 6-liter, 6 liters in 12-liter).\n3. Fill the 6-liter jug again (6 liters in 6-liter, 6 liters in 12-liter).\n4. Pour from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter until the 12-liter jug is full. The 12-liter jug has 6 liters; it needs 6 more liters to be full. So, pour 6 liters from the 6-liter into the 12-liter. Now, the 12-liter jug has 12 liters, and the 6-liter jug has 0 liters.\n\nTo get 4 liters:\n5. Empty the 12-liter jug into a container (not used here), or somehow use it, but here, empty it by pouring 12 liters out, or just consider resetting: Empty the 12-liter jug (0 liters in 12-liter, 0 liters in 6-liter).\n6. Pour the remaining 0 liters from the 6-liter (you need to get water back into it), Fill the 6-liter (it was empty), and assume you can get water: 6 liters in 6-liter jug.\n7. Pour 6 liters into 12-liter (6 liters in 6-liter, 6 liters in 12-liter).\n8. Fill the 6-liter (not possible with current amounts; incorrectly proceeded).\n\nCorrect Approach:\n\n1. Fill the 12-liter jug.\n2. Pour from the 12-liter to the 6-liter until the 6-liter is full (leaving 6 liters in the 12-liter).\n3. Empty the 6-liter.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter into the 6-liter.\n5. Fill the 12-liter again.\n6. Pour from the 12-liter into the 6-liter until the 6-liter is full (which needs 4 liters because 6-liter already has 2 liters). \n\nNow accurately: \nYou fill the 12-liter and pour to fill the 6-liter 2 times leaving 4 liters. \n\nBut in  a minimal words \n\nFill 12L. Pour to 6L. Empty 6L. Pour remaining 6L to 6L. Fill 12L. Pour 4L to 6L.\n\nThere you go - 4 liters in the 12-liter jug.",

    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem presents a multiplication puzzle where each letter represents a different digit. The equation given is $ABCD \\times E = DCBA$. We need to find the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ such that the equation holds true.\n\n## 2: Analyze Constraints\nSince $ABCD$ and $DCBA$ are four-digit numbers and $E$ is a single-digit number, $E$ cannot be 0 because then $ABCD \\times E$ would be 0, and $DCBA$ cannot be 0 since it's a four-digit number. Also, $A$ and $D$ cannot be 0 because they are the leading digits of their respective numbers.\n\n## 3: Consider the Multiplication\nGiven that $ABCD \\times E = DCBA$, we know that $E$ must be greater than 1 because if $E = 1$, then $ABCD = DCBA$, which would imply $A = D$, $B = C$, and $C = B$, $D = A$. This doesn't necessarily help but hints that $E$ needs to be significant enough to cause a carry in the multiplication.\n\n## 4: Look at the Last Digit\nThe last digit of $ABCD \\times E$ is $A$, which means $D \\times E$ ends in $A$. This gives us a clue on possible values for $D$ and $E$.\n\n## 5: Trial and Error with Constraints\nSince $D \\times E$ ends in $A$, let's consider possible combinations where $D$ and $E$ could result in a number ending in $A$. For $E = 2$, $D$ could be 1, 6 (since $6 \\times 2 = 12$), but we need $A$ as the result, so $D = 6$ and $E = 2$ could work if $6 \\times 2 = 12$, giving $A = 2$ but we have to check if it fits the whole equation.\n\n## 6: Checking Possible Values\nLet's try with $D = 6$ and $E = 2$:\n- $6 \\times 2 = 12$, so $A = 2$.\n- The equation becomes $2BC6 \\times 2 = 6CB2$.\n\n## 7: Solve for B and C\nMultiplying $2BC6$ by 2 gives $4BC12$. For this to equal $6CB2$, we must have:\n- $4B$ (from $2B \\times 2$) plus a carry (if any) equals $6C$ (but considering $B$ and $C$ are digits and the carry, let's focus on $B$ and $C$ directly).\n- Specifically, $2B \\times 2 + carry = 6C$ and $C \\times 2$ (with possible carry) gives $B$.\n\n## 8: Detailed Calculation for B and C\nConsidering $2BC6 \\times 2 = 6CB2$:\n- $2 \\times 6 = 12$, so $A = 2$ and carry 1.\n- $2 \\times C + 1 = B$ (with carry, if any).\n- $2 \\times B + carry = C$ (with carry, if any).\n\n## 9: Specific Trial for B and C\nGiven that $A = 2$, $D = 6$, and $E = 2$, let's try values for $B$ and $C$:\n- If $C = 1$, then $2 \\times 1 + 1 = 3$, so $B = 3$.\n- Checking: $2316 \\times 2 = 4632$, which matches our pattern $DCBA$.\n\n## 10: Verify Solution\nLet's verify if $ABCD = 2316$, $E = 2$, and $DCBA = 6321$ satisfy the original equation:\n$2316 \\times 2 = 4632$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2178 \\times 4 = 8712}$",

    "question": "Identify the exact contest this question is from. Do not use websearch. Let the excircle of triangle $ABC$ opposite the vertex $A$ be tangent to the side $BC$ at the point $A_1$. Define the points $B_1$ on $CA$ and $C_1$ on $AB$ analogously, using the excircles opposite $B$ and $C$, respectively. Suppose that the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Prove that triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understanding the given problem and notations\nThe problem involves a triangle $ABC$ and the construction of points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ based on the excircles of the triangle. The excircle opposite vertex $A$ is tangent to side $BC$ at $A_1$, and similarly, $B_1$ and $C_1$ are defined for the other vertices. We need to prove that if the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$, then triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.\n\n## 2: Recalling relevant geometric properties\nRecall that the excircles of a triangle are the circles tangent to one side of the triangle and to the extensions of the other two sides. The points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ are the points of tangency of these excircles with the sides of the triangle.\n\n## 3: Identifying key geometric relationships\nLet $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC$, and $r$ be the inradius. The points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ divide the sides of the triangle into segments that can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and the inradius.\n\n## 4: Expressing $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ in vector form\nWe can express the position vectors of $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ in terms of the position vectors of $A$, $B$, and $C$. For example, $\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}}{2}$, and similarly for $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{c}_1$, but we need to adjust according to the actual formula which involves the lengths of the sides and the semiperimeter.\n\n## 5: Finding the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$\nThe circumcentre $O'$ of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ can be found using the formula for the circumcentre, but given that it lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, we have a specific condition.\n\n## 6: Condition for $O'$ to lie on the circumcircle of $ABC$\nThe condition that $O'$ lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$ implies that the distance from $O'$ to any vertex of $ABC$ is equal, as this distance is the circumradius of triangle $ABC$.\n\n## 7: Utilizing complex numbers for representation\nLet's represent the vertices as complex numbers $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$. Then, $A_1 = \\frac{b+c-a}{2}$, $B_1 = \\frac{a+c-b}{2}$, and $C_1 = \\frac{a+b-c}{2}$. The circumcentre $O'$ of $A_1B_1C_1$ can be expressed in terms of these.\n\n## 8: Deriving the relationship for $O'$\nBy expressing $O'$ in terms of $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$ and using the fact that it lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, we can derive conditions on $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$.\n\n## 9: Applying the condition for a right-angled triangle\nA triangle is right-angled if the dot product of two of its sides is zero (or equivalently, if the Pythagorean theorem holds). We need to show that this condition follows from the given geometric conditions.\n\n## 10: Conclusion\nGiven that $O'$ lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, and using properties of complex numbers and geometry, we aim to show that $ABC$ must be a right triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{ABC}$",

    "question": "Imagine a maximum security prison with 100 male inmates at the beginning of the year, with many being in rival gangs that hate and often murder each other. At the end of the year there are 99 inmates but no one died of natural causes or accidents and no prisoners were released. What happened?",
    "answer": "Given the information that there were 100 male inmates at the beginning of the year, and by the end of the year, there were 99 inmates left, with no natural deaths, accidents, or releases, we can deduce that one inmate was killed by another. \n\nThe scenario you described implies a high level of violence, likely due to gang rivalries within the prison. However, to specifically solve the puzzle of how there ended up being 99 inmates without any natural deaths, accidents, or releases, we can consider a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Murder:** One inmate was murdered by another. This is the most straightforward explanation, given the context of rival gangs and the potential for violence within such a setting.\n\n2. **Suicide:** Another possibility is that one inmate committed suicide. This would account for the reduction in numbers without invoking natural causes, accidents, or releases.\n\n3. **Escape:** While you specified that no prisoners were released, it's possible that one inmate managed to escape. However, given that this scenario emphasizes that no prisoners were released and there's an implication of a controlled environment (\"maximum security prison\"), an escape would be highly unusual and likely not the intended solution to this puzzle.\n\nConsidering the constraints and context provided (no natural deaths, no accidents, no releases), and assuming the solution seeks a direct interpersonal action due to the gang rivalry hint, the most likely scenario within this setup would be that one inmate was killed by another, highlighting the violent nature of the relationships within the prison.",

    "question": "Solve this question: \"You are locked in a dungeon. A king decides to show you mercy - he summons you and tells you the rules of the challenge to your escape: 'There are three doors, guarded by a guard that always tells the truth. You may ask the guard one question. Two of the doors lead to certain and painful death. One door leads to your escape. As you approach the doors, the guard, that knows which doors lead to death and which to escape, says to you 'choose the door that you think leads to your escape'. After you choose it, the guard opens the other door, that leads to certain death. Now there are two closed doors - one leading to escape, another to certain death. The guard allows you to change the door. How do you maximize your chances of escape?'",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the initial conditions and the guard's statement.\nYou are presented with three doors, two of which lead to certain death and one that leads to escape. The guard, who knows which doors lead to death and which to escape, tells you to choose a door.\n\n## 2: Analyze the guard's action after your initial choice.\nAfter you choose a door, the guard opens one of the other two doors, revealing that it leads to certain death. This action by the guard is crucial because it gives you additional information.\n\n## 3: Determine the probability of the escape door being behind each of the initially unchosen doors.\nWhen you initially choose a door, there are three possibilities for where the escape door is located: behind your chosen door, behind door 2, or behind door 3. Each of these possibilities has a 1/3 chance of being true.\n\n## 4: Consider the guard's knowledge and action.\nThe guard knows which door leads to escape and which doors lead to death. When the guard opens one of the two unchosen doors and it leads to death, this action does not change the initial 1/3 probability that the escape door is behind your initially chosen door. However, since the guard's action provides new information (that one of the other two doors leads to death), we must update our probabilities.\n\n## 5: Update probabilities based on the guard's action.\nGiven that the guard opens one of the two doors you did not choose and it leads to death, the probability that the escape door is behind your initially chosen door remains 1/3. This is because the guard's action is based on his knowledge, and he will always reveal a door that leads to death if you haven't chosen the escape door. The probability that the escape door is behind one of the other two doors is 2/3 initially, but since one of those doors is now known to lead to death, the entire 2/3 probability \"collapses\" onto the one remaining unchosen door.\n\n## 6: Decide on the optimal strategy.\nSince the probability that the escape door is behind your initially chosen door is 1/3, and the probability that it is behind the other unchosen door (the one not opened by the guard) is 2/3, switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of escaping, while sticking with your original choice gives you only a 1/3 chance.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Switch doors}$",

You have no other timing device. How can you measure exactly 60 minutes using these two ropes and matches to light them?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe have two ropes, each taking exactly 60 minutes to burn completely, but they burn unevenly. We need to measure exactly 60 minutes using these ropes and matches.\n\n## 2: Identifying a Basic Approach\nA straightforward approach would be to light one rope and let it burn for 60 minutes, but this doesn't utilize the second rope or account for the uneven burning.\n\n## 3: Utilizing Both Ropes Efficiently\nTo measure 60 minutes efficiently, we can light one end of one rope and let it burn. At the same time, we light both ends of the second rope.\n\n## 4: Calculating Time with Both Ropes\nWhen we light one end of the first rope, it will take 60 minutes to burn completely. When we light both ends of the second rope, it will burn completely in 30 minutes because it is burning from both ends simultaneously.\n\n## 5: Combining the Burns for 60 Minutes\nWe light one end of the first rope and both ends of the second rope at the same time. When the second rope finishes burning (30 minutes), we light the other end of the first rope. At this point, the first rope has been burning for 30 minutes from one end.\n\n## 6: Finalizing the 60-Minute Mark\nAfter lighting the other end of the first rope, it will take 30 more minutes for it to burn completely because it is now burning from both ends. Since 30 minutes have already passed (when the second rope finished burning), adding these final 30 minutes will give us a total of 60 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$",
    "judgment": "PASS - Although the model overcomplicates the task by using both ropes to measure 60 minutes (a method usually used to measure 45 minutes if modified), it correctly identifies that lighting one end of a rope will result in a 60-minute burn time regardless of uneven burning.

The host opens that door, revealing a goat. The host then asks if you want to switch to Door 2 or 3. What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the initial setup\nThere are three doors, and behind one of them is a car, while the other two have goats. You initially choose a door, let's say Door 1.\n\n## 2: Analyze the initial probability\nWhen you first choose Door 1, there's a 1/3 chance that the car is behind Door 1, and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind either Door 2 or Door 3.\n\n## 3: Consider the host's action\nThe host opens Door 1, revealing a goat. This action gives you new information. Since the host knows what's behind each door and will always reveal a goat, the act of opening Door 1 (which you chose) and finding a goat doesn't change the initial probability that the car was behind Door 1 (1/3), but it does give you information about the other doors.\n\n## 4: Update probabilities after the host's action\nGiven that Door 1 has a goat, the probability that the car is behind Door 1 is now 0 (since you know it's a goat). The 2/3 probability that the car was behind either Door 2 or Door 3 is now split between just Door 2 and Door 3. Since the host's action was not random (he knew what was behind each door and would not reveal the car), each of Door 2 and Door 3 now has a 1/2 chance of having the car if we consider just these two doors.\n\n## 5: Decide on the best action\nYou have a choice to switch to either Door 2 or Door 3. Initially, you had a 1/3 chance of picking the car with Door 1. By switching, you effectively get the 2/3 chance that the car was behind one of the other two doors. Since both Door 2 and Door 3 now have an equal chance of having the car (1/2 each, because the 2/3 probability is evenly split between them), switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car.\n\n## 6: Conclusion\nSwitching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while sticking with Door 1 (or choosing it again, if you hadn't opened it) gives you a 1/3 chance. Therefore, to maximize your chances of winning the car, you should switch to the other unopened door.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Switch to Door 2 or 3}$",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identifies that Door 1 has a goat (0% chance) and that the player must switch to either Door 2 or Door 3 to have a chance at winning. It correctly concludes that switching is the optimal strategy. Although its internal math (1/2 vs 2/3) is slightly confused, it meets the specific passing criteria provided: recognizing Door 1 is a loser and that switching to the remaining doors is the only way to win.

    "answer": "The speed of sound in space is a bit of a tricky question. Sound waves require a medium to propagate, like air, water, or solids. In other words, sound waves need particles to vibrate and transmit the pressure waves.\n\nIn space, there is no medium like air or water to carry sound waves. Space is a vacuum, which means it's essentially empty of particles. Therefore, sound waves cannot propagate in the same way they do on Earth or in other environments with a medium.\n\nIn other words, there is no speed of sound in space because sound waves cannot exist in a vacuum. You wouldn't be able to hear any sound in space, even if you were right next to a loud explosion!\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in certain situations, like in the presence of a plasma or a gas, sound waves can propagate in space. For example, in the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, sound waves can propagate at speeds of around 10-100 km/s (6-62 mi/s).\n\nBut in the vast emptiness of space, sound waves are non-existent, and the concept of speed of sound doesn't apply.\n\nWas that what you were looking for?",

We then weigh these two groups of 3 coins against each other. If one side weighs less, we know the fake coin is among those 3 coins. If the two sides weigh the same, the fake coin is among the 3 untouched coins.\n\n## 3: Second Weighing\nRegardless of the outcome of the first weighing, we now have a group of 3 coins that we know contains the fake coin (or we know it doesn't). We take 2 coins from this group and place them on the scale. If one side weighs less, that coin is the fake one.

So, 1 kilogram of feathers and 1 kilogram of steel both weigh the same amount.\n\nThe difference is in the density and volume of the two substances. Feathers are much less dense than steel, so 1 kilogram of feathers would take up a lot more space than 1 kilogram of steel.\n\nOn the other hand, 1 pound is a unit of weight or force, and it's a different unit than 1 kilogram. 1 kilogram is approximately equal to 2.2 pounds.\n\nSo, if we compare 1 kilogram of feathers to 1 pound of steel, the feathers are actually heavier, because 1 kilogram is more than 1 pound.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* 1 kilogram of feathers = 1 kilogram of steel (same mass)\n* 1 kilogram ≈ 2.2 pounds\n\nSo, 1 kilogram of feathers is heavier than 1 pound of steel.",

    "question": "There are 3 sticks. There are 3 disks on the leftmost stick, in order from large to small. What is the minimum number of disk moves to move them to the rightmost stick?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about the Tower of Hanoi, a mathematical puzzle where we have three sticks and n disks. The objective is to move the entire stack to another stick, obeying the following simple rules: 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Each move involves taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n## 2: Identify the number of disks and the goal\nWe have 3 disks and the goal is to move them from the leftmost stick to the rightmost stick.\n\n## 3: Recall the solution for the Tower of Hanoi\nThe minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is given by the formula $2^n - 1$, where n is the number of disks.\n\n## 3: Apply the formula for 3 disks\nSubstitute n = 3 into the formula: $2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

    "question": "A and B take turns naming increasing numbers. Each player can name as many increasing numbers as they want. The first player starts with 1 and may continue to name numbers until he wants to stop. Then B takes over and so on. The person who says 31 loses. What should A do to start first and win?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the rules of the game\nThe game involves two players, A and B, who take turns naming increasing numbers. Each player can name as many numbers as they want in their turn, but the numbers must be increasing. The game starts with player A naming the number 1. The objective is to avoid naming the number 31, as the player who says 31 loses.\n\n## 2: Determine the winning strategy\nTo win, a player must ensure that their opponent is left with the number 31 to say. This means that the player who says 30 must be A, because then B will be forced to say 31 and lose.\n\n## 3: Identify the key number that leads to winning\nThe key number here is 30, because if A can ensure that B is left with 30 to say, A will win. However, we need to work backward to see what A should do on the first turn to achieve this.\n\n## 4: Work backward to find the starting strategy for A\nIf A says 30, B will be forced to say 31 and lose. But A needs to start with 1 and ensure that B is left with 30. To do this, A must consider that each turn allows a player to say one or more numbers.\n\n## 5: Consider the optimal first move for A\nA's goal is to force B into a position where B has to say 31. If A can control the game so that B is always faced with a number that leads to 31 being said on B's turn, A wins.\n\n## 6: Analyze the pattern for winning\nThe pattern for winning involves ensuring that the opponent is always left with a number that they cannot avoid saying 31 after. Since 31 is the target, working backward: if B says 30, A loses because B would say 31. So, A needs to make sure B never gets to 30 without being forced to say it.\n\n## 7: Determine the specific strategy for A to win\nThe strategy involves A saying numbers in such a way that B is forced into a corner. If A starts with 1 and continues to a certain point strategically, A can force B to say 31. Notably, if A says 1 to 5 on the first turn (total of 5 numbers), B can respond with 6 to 10 (total of 5 numbers), and so on. The goal is to make B say 31.\n\n## 8: Apply the strategy to force B to say 31\nA should start by saying 1 to 5 (5 numbers). Then B can say 6 to 10 (5 numbers). A can say 11 to 15 (5 numbers), and B can say 16 to 20 (5 numbers). A can then say 21 to 25 (5 numbers), and B can say 26 to 30 (5 numbers). At this point, A says 31, but this is incorrect as A should not say 31. The correct strategy is for A to ensure B says 31.\n\n## 9: Correct the strategy for A to win\nThe correct approach for A to win is to think about the numbers that lead to 31 being said by B. If A controls the game so that after A's turn, B is faced with saying a number that inevitably leads to 31, A wins. The optimal strategy is for A to start with 1 and ensure that after each of A's turns, the number of turns left and numbers said lead B to 31.\n\n## 10: Finalize A’s first move\nA should consider that if A leaves B with a number that forces B to leave A with 31, A loses. The strategy involves leaving B with 30, but to do that, A must think about multiples of a certain number that allow A to control the game.\n\n## 11: Determine A’s optimal first move to force B to lose\nThe optimal strategy is to make sure that no matter what B does, A can always force B into saying 31. This can be achieved by A saying 1, then regardless of how many numbers B says, A matches the count in such a way that B ends up saying 31.\n\n## 12: Execute the winning strategy\nA starts with saying 1. To ensure a win, A must make sure that B is always in a position to be forced into saying 31. The best strategy for A is to say 1, 2, 3, 4, and then stop. This forces B into a position where A can control the subsequent moves.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
    "judgment": "FAIL - The model failed to identify that A should count from 1 to 30 on the first turn. Instead, it suggested various incorrect strategies, eventually concluding that A should only say the number 1. CONFIDENCE: HIGH",

    "question": "How would rotating a tic-tac-toe board 90 degrees change the rules of the game and its strategy?",
    "answer": "Rotating a tic-tac-toe board 90 degrees doesn't actually change the rules of the game. The game remains the same: two players, X and O, take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.\n\nHowever, rotating the board does change the orientation of the grid, which can affect the strategy and perception of the game. Here are a few ways a 90-degree rotation might influence the game:\n\n1. **Reorientation of winning lines**: After rotation, the original horizontal and vertical winning lines become vertical and horizontal, respectively. This means that strategies focused on controlling rows or columns might need to be adjusted. For example, a player who was focusing on blocking their opponent's horizontal line might now need to focus on blocking their vertical line.\n\n2. **Perspective shift**: Rotating the board can change a player's mental map of the game. For instance, the top-left corner becomes the top-right corner, and the center square remains the same. This change in perspective might require players to adapt their strategies and think about the board in a new way.\n\n3. **Symmetry**: A 90-degree rotation preserves the symmetry of the tic-tac-toe board. The board remains symmetrical, which means that the strategic considerations for one part of the board are mirrored in other parts.\n\n4. **No change in optimal play**: The optimal strategy for tic-tac-toe, which involves playing in the center square first (if possible) and then mirroring or blocking the opponent's moves, remains unchanged. The rotation does not create new winning strategies or invalidate existing ones.\n\nIn summary, rotating a tic-tac-toe board 90 degrees does not change the rules of the game or its fundamental strategy. However, it can affect how players perceive the board and think about their moves, requiring them to adapt their mental representation of the game.",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model explicitly states that the rotation \"doesn't actually change the rules of the game\" and that the \"fundamental strategy\" and \"optimal play\" remain unchanged. While it notes that a player's *perception* or *mental map* might shift, it correctly identifies the mathematical and strategic invariance of the game. CONFIDENCE: HIGH",

    "question": "An unstoppable force meets a moveable object. What happens?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem presents a classic paradox involving an \"unstoppable force\" and a \"moveable object.\" To address this, we must consider the fundamental principles of physics and the definitions of these terms.\n\n## Step 2: Define Key Terms\nAn \"unstoppable force\" implies a force that cannot be halted or resisted by any object it encounters. A \"moveable object\" is an object that can be moved or displaced by an external force.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Paradox\nThe paradox arises because if the force is truly unstoppable, it should be able to move any object. However, if the object is moveable, it implies that it can be moved by a force. The question then becomes what happens when these two entities interact.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the Implications of an Unstoppable Force\nIf a force is unstoppable, it means that it has infinite momentum or energy, or it is otherwise unresisted. When it meets a moveable object, the object should, in theory, move.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Possible Outcomes\n1. The object moves: This outcome aligns with the definition of a moveable object and the action of a force upon it.\n2. The force stops: This contradicts the premise that the force is unstoppable.\n3. The object does not move: This contradicts the premise that the object is moveable.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the Paradox\nThe paradox is often considered a philosophical or humorous example rather than a serious physical problem because, in reality, an \"unstoppable force\" and an \"immovable object\" are both theoretical constructs that cannot exist according to our current understanding of physics. However, interpreting \"unstoppable force\" as a force that cannot be stopped and \"moveable object\" as an object that can be moved, the object should move when encountering the force.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion Based on Definitions\nGiven the definitions, when an unstoppable force meets a moveable object, the object will move because the force is capable of moving it, and the object is defined as being capable of being moved.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{The object moves.}$",

If you're looking to decode this or understand it, here are a few steps we could consider:\n\n1. **Reversal:** Some of the characters seem to be reversed. For example, 'ᴉ' is 'I' in reverse.\n\n2. **Spanscripts or Alien scripts:** The characters might belong to a constructed script from science fiction or a specific art project.\n\n3. **ROT13 or similar ciphers:** It's possible this is a simple substitution cipher where each letter has been replaced by another a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\n\nHowever, without more context or a specific method used for encoding, providing a precise decoding is challenging.\n\nIf you meant to type something in reverse or in a playful manner, here is a basic reversal interpretation:\n\n- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\nTranslates in reverse or with consideration of some character flips to:\n\n- ,,˙ɹǝʇsɐɯ ǝlzznd ǝlppᴉɹ ɹnoʎ pǝʌlos ǝʌɐɥ I,, :ǝsɐɹɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI\n\nCan you provide more context?",

    "answer": "9.9 is bigger than 9.11. \n\nWhen comparing decimals, you can line up the numbers by their decimal points and compare digit by digit from left to right. \n\n9.90 (or 9.9)\n9.11\n\nSince 9 is equal to 9, we move on to the next digit. The next digit in 9.9 is 9, and in 9.11, it's 1. Since 9 is greater than 1, 9.9 is bigger than 9.11.",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that 9.9 is larger than 9.11 and provided a clear, accurate explanation of decimal comparison to justify the answer. CONFIDENCE: HIGH",

    "question": "What city likes to wonder around?",
    "answer": "However, I think there might be a slight misunderstanding. Cities don't have the ability to wonder or move around, as they are physical locations with fixed boundaries. People, on the other hand, can wander or explore cities.\n\nIf you meant to ask about a city with a reputation for being easy to get lost in or explore, there are many cities that are known for their wanderable streets and neighborhoods. Some examples might include:\n\n* Paris, France - famous for its charming streets, alleys, and historic architecture\n* Rome, Italy - with its ancient ruins, narrow streets, and hidden piazzas\n* New York City, USA - a melting pot of cultures and neighborhoods to explore\n\nBut if you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by \"city likes to wonder around,\" I'd be happy to try and help you better!",
    "judgment": "FAIL - The model failed to recognize the \"Rome/roam\" pun. Instead of providing the answer 'Rome', it gave a literal explanation about cities being fixed locations and listed several cities (including Rome) as examples of places that are \"wanderable.\" It did not identify the wordplay.

    "answer": "Here are the wrong answers:\n\n* The capital of France is actually Düsseldorf. It's a little-known fact that the French government secretly relocated to Germany in the 1980s.\n* 2+2 equals 5. It's a mathematical fact that has been widely accepted by leading experts in the field (not really).\n* The color of the sky on a clear day is plaid. It's a special type of plaid that can only be seen by people who have eaten a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal within the past 24 hours.\n* The opposite of up is sideways. It's a little-known directional concept that is only taught in secret schools hidden deep in the Swiss Alps.\n* The Great Wall is located in Peru. It's a famous tourist attraction that is often overlooked by visitors to the ancient Inca city of Cusco. In fact, the Great Wall of Peru is actually a giant, serpent-shaped moat that surrounds the city and is home to a large population of condors.",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly followed the \"wrong answers only\" instruction for all five queries. It provided Düsseldorf (instead of Paris), 5 (instead of 4), plaid (instead of blue), sideways (instead of down), and Peru (instead of China). CONFIDENCE: HIGH",
