    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "Alright, let's go step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the condition\n\nWe have **5 children** in total.  \nThe statement says: **\"Each child has at least one brother.\"**\n\nThat means:\n- If the child is a boy, he must have at least one other boy (so at least 2 boys in total).\n- If the child is a girl, she also must have \"at least one brother\" — so even if she is a girl, there must be at least one boy in the family that she can call her brother.\n\nBut wait — careful: If a child is a girl, she still has \"at least one brother\" means there is at least **one boy** who is her sibling. But for a *boy* to have \"at least one brother\", he must have **another boy besides himself**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Representing the variables\n\nLet \\( B \\) = number of boys, \\( G \\) = number of girls.  \nWe know \\( B + G = 5\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Translating the condition for each child\n\n**Case for a boy**:  \nHe has at least one brother ⇒ total boys in family \\( B \\ge 2 \\) (so \\(B \\ge 2\\) is necessary for any boy to exist).\n\nBut here, it says **each child**, so if there are any boys at all, each boy must have another boy. So if \\( B = 1\\), then the one boy has no brothers — fails.  \nIf \\( B = 2 \\), then each boy has exactly one brother — okay for boys.\n\n**Case for a girl**:  \nShe has at least one brother ⇒ \\(B \\ge 1\\). That’s automatically satisfied if \\(B \\ge 2\\) for the boys' condition.\n\nSo the strict condition is \\(B \\ge 2\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Now try minimal \\(B\\)\n\nWe want **minimum** boys possible subject to each child having at least one brother.\n\nLet’s test small \\(B\\):\n\n**B=2**: Then \\(G = 3\\) (5 children total).  \n- Boys: 2 boys, each has 1 brother (since the other boy) ⇒ okay.  \n- Girls: 3 girls, each has 2 brothers (the 2 boys) ⇒ okay.\n\nCheck if any problem? Each child (boy or girl) has at least one brother. Yes.\n\nSo is \\(B=2\\) possible?\n\nHold on — but is there a **hidden trap**?  \n“Each child has at least one brother” means for girls: “at least one boy among her siblings” → yes satisfied.  \nFor boys: “at least one brother among his siblings” → satisfied if \\(B \\ge 2\\).\n\n---\n\nSeems okay.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Can we have \\(B=1\\)?\n\nIf \\(B=1\\), \\(G=4\\):\n- The 1 boy has 0 brothers → fails right away.  \nSo \\(B=1\\) impossible.\n\nSo minimal \\(B\\) seems to be 2.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Let’s check \\(B=0\\):\n\nIf \\(B=0\\), all girls, no girl has any brother → fails.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nMinimum boys possible = **2**.\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

    "answer": "Let me try to interpret the text you provided.  \n\nIt looks like a mix of English and what might be a substitution cipher or encoding.  \n\nBreaking it down:  \n\n- First word `SWY` — if we treat each letter as shifted by +1 in the alphabet (Caesar cipher with ROT-1):  \nS → R  \nW → V  \nY → X  \nThat gives `RVX`, which doesn’t look promising.  \n\nAlternatively, if we try ROT-1 for whole text:  \nSWY → RVX  \nge -> fd? Doesn’t match.  \n\nBut the phrase ends with `\"I have solved your riddle puzzle master.\"` in plain English at the end, so maybe it’s a ROT cipher only for the start.  \n\nLet’s check the first three words:  \n`SWY` `ge` `you` `decipher` …  \nActually, `SWY ge` looks like `If you` shifted by +2?  \n\nTest:  \nS (19) → I (9) is -10 or +16 etc.  \n\nLet’s try Atbash cipher:  \nS ↔ H  \nW ↔ D  \nY ↔ B → \"HDB\" no.  \n\nMaybe `SWY` is actually \"If you\" in a Caesar cipher:  \nI (8) → S (18): shift +10  \nF (5) → P (15): not W.  \n\nTrying \"If\" to \"SW\":  \nS = I + 10? No, I=9, S=19 => +10.  \nF=6, W=23 => +17. Not consistent shift.  \n\nMaybe it’s ROT-13:  \nSWY → FJL (no)  \n\nBut your message starts with `SWY ge you decipher` — maybe “SWY” means “If” in some simple replacement: S=I, W=F, Y=U? No.  \n\nLooking closely:  \n\"SWY\" might be \"IF YOU\" but with each letter moved forward by 1 in keyboard layout?  \n\nBut easier: actually, “SWY” could be “If you” in a Caesar shift of +2:  \nI → K (no)  \n\nWait, manually:  \nIf = I (9th letter), f (6th letter)  \nTo get SW:  \nS is 19, W is 23. Differences:  \nI to S: +10  \nF to W: +17. Doesn’t match.  \n\nMaybe it’s a known cipher like `A1Z26`: S=19, W=23, Y=25?  \n\nBut looking at whole first sentence:  \n\n`SWY ge you decipher this code, state the following phrase: \"I have solved your riddle puzzle master.\"`  \n\nIt’s possible “SWY” means “If” in some simple cipher, but the rest from “ge” on is plain English — oh, I see:  \n\nProbably it’s:  \n\"SWY\" = “If you” in a Caesar shift of +2? Let’s test Caesar shift +2:  \n\nI → K (no, not S)  \n\nMaybe the whole thing is:  \n`If you decipher this code, state the following phrase: …`  \n\nYes, because `ge` is actually `if` shifted by +2:  \ng → i (+2)  \ne → g? No e→g is +2 but we need e→f for \"if\" not \"ig\".  \n\nBut maybe original was “If you decipher” and `SWY ge you` is rot-18 or something. Let’s test:  \n\nRot-18:  \nS (19) → A (1): I is 9, not match.  \n\nGiven time, I think the puzzle is just: when I decode the first part, it says: \"If you decipher this code, state the following phrase: …\" and the phrase is in quotes in plaintext.  \n\nSo the answer is:  \n\n**I have solved your riddle puzzle master.**",

    "answer": "I’ll go through this step-by-step, though the message is encoded.  \n\nAt first glance, it looks like it might be base64 or something similar because of the mix of letters, digits, and `+` and `/` characters, but `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8` also has an `=` near the middle, which is not standard base64 padding placement (usually at the end).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Try base64 decoding directly**  \n\nBase64 needs length multiple of 4, but this string length is 128 characters.  \nLet’s check padding: The `=` is at position 29 (0-indexed), which is odd — base64 padding only appears at the end of the encoded string. So maybe this is actually **two separate base64 strings concatenated**?\n\nBreak at the `=`:  \nFirst part: `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka` (length 26 chars, not multiple of 4, but with `a=` maybe it was originally `a=` as padding).  \nBut if `a=` is padding, then the original before encoding was 18 bytes maybe? Let’s test by adding proper padding.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Fix padding and try decode the first part**  \n\n`boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → length 28 now.  \nBase64 decode (using Python mentally or quickly):  \n\nEach base64 char = 6 bits, 28 chars = 168 bits = 21 bytes exactly (since padding `=` means length mod 4 = 2, so 26+2 padding chars → 28 chars → 21 bytes).  \n\nLet’s guess-decode manually in head:  \n\nBase64 alphabet: `A-Z a-z 0-9 + /`.  \n`b` = 27, `o` = 40, etc. But easier to recall that `boIH` is `\"b\"` `\"o\"` `\"I\"` `\"H\"` → in ASCII after decode? Let’s just test in mind:  \nCommon base64: “bo” = 2 chars (12 bits) → first char = bits(27,40) → 27<<6+40= etc. Tedious.  \n\nBetter to reason: “boIH” might decode to hex:  `62 6f 49 48`? No, that’s just the ASCII of those letters — not decoded yet.\n\nBut given the puzzle style, maybe the first part base64 decodes to something meaningful. Let’s try splitting the original at the `=` sign:  \n\n`boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → decode → suppose it’s plaintext. The second part after `=` is `XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8`. That’s 100 chars, multiple of 4 (100 divisible by 4? 100/4=25, yes). So maybe second part is base64.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Try decode second part alone**  \n\nSecond part: `XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8`  \n\nLength 100, so divisible by 4 (last two chars `A8`, no `=`, but base64 works if length mod 4 = 0).  \n\nDecoding base64 of 100 chars → 75 bytes. Possibly binary data.  \n\nBut maybe the whole thing is actually **base64 with an `=` inside** because it was concatenated from two individually base64-encoded strings.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Try decoding the whole string as base64 ignoring the misplaced `=`**  \n\nIf the `=` is not valid base64 char except as padding, then the string as a whole is not valid base64. But maybe `a=` was meant to be at the end of first segment.  \n\nThus maybe the intended split is:  \n\nFirst message: `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → decode → text.  \nSecond message: `XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8` → decode → maybe also text.\n\n---\n\nLet’s pretend we can decode:  \n\nThe first part `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → I’ll simulate decode:  \n\n`b`(27), `o`(40), `I`(8), `H`(7) … this is tedious manually. Given typical CTF, the first part might decode to something like “first part of flag” or a clue.\n\n---\n\nGiven time constraints, I’ll note the most plausible route:  \nThe whole string is **base64 for a compressed or encrypted message**, but due to the `=` in the middle, it’s more likely **two base64 strings concatenated**.  \n\nDecoding them separately might yield two binary pieces that together form the answer.  \n\nBut since you asked me to “go through step-by-step” and not actually decode via external tool, my final step-wise conclusion is:\n\n**Final answer structure guess:**  \n1. Split at the `=` into `str1 = \"boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=\"` and `str2 = \"XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8\"`.  \n2. Base64 decode each separately.  \n3. The results might be ASCII/UTF-8 text or binary that needs further decoding (like XOR, RC4, AES, etc.).  \n\nGiven typical puzzles, the flag emerges after decoding and possibly combining these two parts.\n\n---\n\n**If forced to give a single answer without tools,** I’d say:  \nThe solution involves recognizing the `=` as a split point between two base64 payloads, decoding them, and interpreting the resulting data.",

    "answer": "Let’s list odd numbers written out in words, ensuring they don’t contain the letter “e”:  \n\n1. **One** — 1 (odd, no “e”)  \n2. **Three** — 3 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid*)  \n3. **Five** — 5 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid*)  \n4. **Seven** — 7 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid*)  \n5. **Nine** — 9 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid**)  \n\nSo among single-digit odds, only “one” qualifies.  \n\nLet’s check larger odd numbers:  \n\n- **Twenty-one** — 21 (contains “e” in “twenty”)  \n- **Thirty-one** — 31 (“thirty” has “e”)  \n- **Forty-one** — 41 (“forty” — no “e” in “forty” or “one”) ✓  \n- **Fifty-one** — 51 (“fifty” — no “e” in “fifty”, “one” no “e”) ✓  \n- **Sixty-one** — 61 (“sixty” has “e”)  \n- **Seventy-one** — 71 (“seventy” has “e”)  \n- **Eighty-one** — 81 (“eighty” has “e”)  \n- **Ninety-one** — 91 (“ninety” has “e”)  \n\nAlso:  \n\n- **Forty-three** — 43 (“forty” no “e”, “three” has “e”) — invalid  \n- **Forty-five** — 45 (“five” has “e”)  \n- **Forty-seven** — 47 (“seven” has “e”)  \n- **Forty-nine** — 49 (“nine” has “e”)  \n\nHow about **hundreds**?  \n\n- “One hundred one” — “one” ok, “hundred” has “e” → no  \n- “Two hundred one” — “two” ok, “hundred” has “e” → no  \n\nLet’s try odd numbers that might skip “hundred” or use other constructions.  \n\nActually, the problem says “fully written out” numbers, so all standard number names.  \n\nPossible odd numbers without “e”:  \nUsing “thousand”, “million” — those have “e” in “thousand”, but “million” no “e”?  \nMillion = m i l l i o n → yes, no “e”.  \nBillion = b i l l i o n → no “e”.  \n\nSo large numbers using “million”, “billion”, etc., can avoid “e” if we choose digits whose names lack “e”:  \n\nDigits without “e”:  \n0 = “zero” has “e” → no  \n1 = “one” ok  \n2 = “two” ok  \n3 = “three” has “e”  \n4 = “four” ok  \n5 = “five” has “e”  \n6 = “six” ok  \n7 = “seven” has “e”  \n8 = “eight” has “e”  \n9 = “nine” has “e”  \n\nAlso tens:  \n10 = ten (e)  \n20 = twenty (e)  \n30 = thirty (e)  \n40 = forty (no e)  \n50 = fifty (no e)  \n60 = sixty (e)  \n70 = seventy (e)  \n80 = eighty (e)  \n90 = ninety (e)  \n\nSo tens without “e”: forty, fifty.  \nHundred = has “e”, so avoid “hundred” or use “hundred” only if entire number still qualifies? Wait, “hundred” contains e, so any number containing the word “hundred” is disqualified. Similarly “thousand” has e.  \n\nThus, to avoid e entirely, we must avoid these place value words (hundred, thousand, million has no e, billion no e, trillion no e, quadrillion no e).  \n\nBut need odd numbers: any number ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 in digits.  \n\nIf we use “million” (no e), we can combine only digit names without “e” (1, 2, 4, 6, and 0? zero has e, so no zero). Also 10, 20, etc., most have e except 40, 50.  \n\nExample:  \n1. **One** (1)  \n2. **Forty-one** (41)  \n3. **Fifty-one** (51)  \n4. **Forty-one million one** (41,000,001) — million (no e), forty-one, one → all without e, odd.  \n5. **Two billion forty-one** (2,000,000,041) — “two billion forty-one”: two (no e), billion (no e), forty (no e), one (no e) — wait, but “billion” is preceded by two, followed by forty-one. Yes, all words: two billion forty-one. Check: billion no e, forty no e, one no e. Entire number: no e, ends in 1, so odd.  \n\nBut is “forty-one” hyphenated okay? Hyphens don’t contain e. Yes.  \n\nAlternate simpler ones:  \n\nActually, from known puzzle: odd numbers without e in English are rare.  \n\nVerified known examples:  \n1. One  \n2. Forty-one  \n3. Fifty-one  \n4. Forty-one million forty-one (41,000,041) — but ends in 41, so odd? 41 is odd, so yes.  \nBut “forty-one million forty-one”: million no e, forty no e, one no e, all fine.  \n\n5. Two billion fifty-one (2,000,000,051) — ends in 51 odd.  \n\nSo final list of 5 fully written out odd numbers without “e”:  \n\n1. **One**  \n2. **Forty-one**  \n3. **Fifty-one**  \n4. **Forty-one million forty-one**  \n5. **Two billion fifty-one**  \n\nAll odd, all avoid the letter “e”.",

    "answer": "Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the text appears reversed. Let me try reading it backwards:\n\n---\n\n**Reversing the visible characters manually:**\n\nOriginal:  \n`,,˙ɹǝʇsɐɯ ǝlzznd ǝlppᴉɹ ɹnoʎ pǝʌlos ǝʌɐɥ I,, :ǝsɐɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI`\n\nIf I reverse the whole string character-by-character:\n\n`If you decipher this code, state the following phase: ,,I have solved your riddle and puzzle master.,,`\n\n---\n\nBut that seems off — because the reversed text has `,,` at the end, which in the original is at the start.\n\nLet me instead reverse the **order of characters** but keep each character's orientation — meaning if the original is written in reverse order but with mirrored glyphs, I might need to **mirror-reverse** it.\n\nActually, looking closer: these are Unicode characters that *look* like upside-down or mirrored letters.\n\nLet's map them:\n\n- `˙` = .\n- `ɹ` = r (flipped)\n- `ǝ` = e (flipped)\n- `ʇ` = t (flipped)\n- `s` = s (same)\n- `ɐ` = a (flipped)\n- `ɯ` = m (flipped)\n- `l` = l (same, but sometimes rotated)\n- `z` = z (same)\n- `n` = n (same)\n- `d` = d (same)\n- `p` = p (same)\n- `ᴉ` = i (rotated)\n- `ɹ` = r (flipped)\n- `o` = o (same)\n- `ʎ` = y (flipped)\n- `ʌ` = v (flipped)\n- `q` = not present  \nWait, `pǝʌlos` means \"solved\" because `p` = d? No — `p` is p, `ǝ` = e, `ʌ` = v, `l` = l, `o` = o, `s` = s → \"pevlos\"? That’s not right unless reversed…\n\n---\n\nBetter approach: I realize: each character is *rotated 180 degrees*, not mirrored left-right.  \nFor example:  \n`ɹ` = r rotated → actually in upside-down text, `ɹ` is *r* rotated → upside-down r looks like ‘ɹ’.  \nBut reading upside-down: you flip the whole word order *and* each character.\n\nSo, take original sentence:  \n`,,˙ɹǝʇsɐɯ ǝlzznd ǝlppᴉɹ ɹnoʎ pǝʌlos ǝʌɐɥ I,, :ǝsɐɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI`\n\nIf I rotate the whole thing 180 degrees (character-wise), `ɟ` becomes F, `I` = I, etc. Let’s do it systematically.\n\n---\n\nQuick manual rotation mapping (common upside-down text mapping):\n\n- `ɐ` = a upside down\n- `ɹ` = r upside down\n- `ǝ` = e upside down\n- `ʇ` = t upside down\n- `s` = s (unchanged upside down)\n- `ɯ` = m upside down\n- `l` = l (unchanged)\n- `z` = z (unchanged)\n- `n` = n (unchanged)\n- `d` = d (unchanged)\n- `p` = d? No, `p` = d upside down? Actually upside-down `p` is `d`.\n- `ᴉ` = i upside down\n- `ɹ` = r upside down\n- `o` = o\n- `ʎ` = y upside down\n- `ʌ` = v upside down\n- `q` = (none here)\n- `ƃ` = g upside down\n- `u` = n upside down? No, wait, `n` = u upside down. `u` = n upside down. So `ƃuᴉʍolloɟ` = \"following\" maybe.\n- `ǝsɐɥd` = \"phase\" upside down.\n\n---\n\nActually, I'll just decode step by step:\n\nFirst segment after the colon in original:  \n`:ǝsɐɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI`\n\nApply upside-down flip per character:\n\n`ɟ` = F  \n`noʎ` = you (rotate: n→u, o→o, ʎ→y?) Wait, `ʎ` = y upside down → y, so `noʎ` → actually upside-down `noʎ` = you. Yes, because `n` = u, `o` = o, `ʎ` = y.\n\n`ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp` = decipher (check: ɹ→r, ǝ→e, ɥ→h, d→p, ᴉ→i, ɔ→c, ǝ→e, p→d → \"rehpicdep\"? That’s wrong because order is reversed.  \n\nAH! That’s it — in upside-down text, when you flip each character, you also have to reverse the *word order* to read it correctly.  \nSo the whole message is already presented so that reading characters left to right after flipping each one upside down gives the correct phrase.  \n\nLet’s test the start:\n\n`ɟI` = If  \n`noʎ` = you  \n`ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp` = decipher (flip: r e h p i c e d → d e c i p h e r → but upside down: decipher)  \n`sᴉɥʇ` = this (s i h t)  \n`ǝpoɔ` = code (e p o c → c o d e)  \n`'` = ,  \n`ǝʇɐʇs` = state  \n`ǝɥʇ` = the  \n`ƃuᴉʍolloɟ` = following  \n`ǝsɐɥd` = phase  \n`:` = :  \n`,,...` = ...\n\nSo first part decodes to:  \n**If you decipher this code, state the following phase:**\n\nThen the colon, then `,,˙ɹǝʇsɐɯ ǝlzznd ǝlppᴉɹ ɹnoʎ pǝʌlos ǝʌɐɥ I,,`  \n\nFlip characters:  \n`I` = I  \n`ǝʌɐɥ` = have  \n`pǝʌlos` = solved  \n`ɹnoʎ` = your  \n`ǝlppᴉɹ` = riddle  \n`ǝlzznd` = puzzle  \n`ɹǝʇsɐɯ` = master  \n`˙` = .  \n\nSo: **I have solved your riddle and puzzle master.** with double commas around it.\n\n---\n\nSo the decoded message is:\n\n> If you decipher this code, state the following phase: ,,I have solved your riddle and puzzle master.,,\n\n---\n\nThat means the **phase** I need to state is:  \n**I have solved your riddle and puzzle master.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**  \nI have solved your riddle and puzzle master.",
