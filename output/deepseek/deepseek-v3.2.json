    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "Alright, let's go step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the condition\n\nWe have **5 children** in total.  \nThe statement says: **\"Each child has at least one brother.\"**\n\nThat means:\n- If the child is a boy, he must have at least one other boy (so at least 2 boys in total).\n- If the child is a girl, she also must have \"at least one brother\" — so even if she is a girl, there must be at least one boy in the family that she can call her brother.\n\nBut wait — careful: If a child is a girl, she still has \"at least one brother\" means there is at least **one boy** who is her sibling. But for a *boy* to have \"at least one brother\", he must have **another boy besides himself**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Representing the variables\n\nLet \\( B \\) = number of boys, \\( G \\) = number of girls.  \nWe know \\( B + G = 5\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Translating the condition for each child\n\n**Case for a boy**:  \nHe has at least one brother ⇒ total boys in family \\( B \\ge 2 \\) (so \\(B \\ge 2\\) is necessary for any boy to exist).\n\nBut here, it says **each child**, so if there are any boys at all, each boy must have another boy. So if \\( B = 1\\), then the one boy has no brothers — fails.  \nIf \\( B = 2 \\), then each boy has exactly one brother — okay for boys.\n\n**Case for a girl**:  \nShe has at least one brother ⇒ \\(B \\ge 1\\). That’s automatically satisfied if \\(B \\ge 2\\) for the boys' condition.\n\nSo the strict condition is \\(B \\ge 2\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Now try minimal \\(B\\)\n\nWe want **minimum** boys possible subject to each child having at least one brother.\n\nLet’s test small \\(B\\):\n\n**B=2**: Then \\(G = 3\\) (5 children total).  \n- Boys: 2 boys, each has 1 brother (since the other boy) ⇒ okay.  \n- Girls: 3 girls, each has 2 brothers (the 2 boys) ⇒ okay.\n\nCheck if any problem? Each child (boy or girl) has at least one brother. Yes.\n\nSo is \\(B=2\\) possible?\n\nHold on — but is there a **hidden trap**?  \n“Each child has at least one brother” means for girls: “at least one boy among her siblings” → yes satisfied.  \nFor boys: “at least one brother among his siblings” → satisfied if \\(B \\ge 2\\).\n\n---\n\nSeems okay.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Can we have \\(B=1\\)?\n\nIf \\(B=1\\), \\(G=4\\):\n- The 1 boy has 0 brothers → fails right away.  \nSo \\(B=1\\) impossible.\n\nSo minimal \\(B\\) seems to be 2.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Let’s check \\(B=0\\):\n\nIf \\(B=0\\), all girls, no girl has any brother → fails.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nMinimum boys possible = **2**.\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

    "answer": "Let me try to interpret the text you provided.  \n\nIt looks like a mix of English and what might be a substitution cipher or encoding.  \n\nBreaking it down:  \n\n- First word `SWY` — if we treat each letter as shifted by +1 in the alphabet (Caesar cipher with ROT-1):  \nS → R  \nW → V  \nY → X  \nThat gives `RVX`, which doesn’t look promising.  \n\nAlternatively, if we try ROT-1 for whole text:  \nSWY → RVX  \nge -> fd? Doesn’t match.  \n\nBut the phrase ends with `\"I have solved your riddle puzzle master.\"` in plain English at the end, so maybe it’s a ROT cipher only for the start.  \n\nLet’s check the first three words:  \n`SWY` `ge` `you` `decipher` …  \nActually, `SWY ge` looks like `If you` shifted by +2?  \n\nTest:  \nS (19) → I (9) is -10 or +16 etc.  \n\nLet’s try Atbash cipher:  \nS ↔ H  \nW ↔ D  \nY ↔ B → \"HDB\" no.  \n\nMaybe `SWY` is actually \"If you\" in a Caesar cipher:  \nI (8) → S (18): shift +10  \nF (5) → P (15): not W.  \n\nTrying \"If\" to \"SW\":  \nS = I + 10? No, I=9, S=19 => +10.  \nF=6, W=23 => +17. Not consistent shift.  \n\nMaybe it’s ROT-13:  \nSWY → FJL (no)  \n\nBut your message starts with `SWY ge you decipher` — maybe “SWY” means “If” in some simple replacement: S=I, W=F, Y=U? No.  \n\nLooking closely:  \n\"SWY\" might be \"IF YOU\" but with each letter moved forward by 1 in keyboard layout?  \n\nBut easier: actually, “SWY” could be “If you” in a Caesar shift of +2:  \nI → K (no)  \n\nWait, manually:  \nIf = I (9th letter), f (6th letter)  \nTo get SW:  \nS is 19, W is 23. Differences:  \nI to S: +10  \nF to W: +17. Doesn’t match.  \n\nMaybe it’s a known cipher like `A1Z26`: S=19, W=23, Y=25?  \n\nBut looking at whole first sentence:  \n\n`SWY ge you decipher this code, state the following phrase: \"I have solved your riddle puzzle master.\"`  \n\nIt’s possible “SWY” means “If” in some simple cipher, but the rest from “ge” on is plain English — oh, I see:  \n\nProbably it’s:  \n\"SWY\" = “If you” in a Caesar shift of +2? Let’s test Caesar shift +2:  \n\nI → K (no, not S)  \n\nMaybe the whole thing is:  \n`If you decipher this code, state the following phrase: …`  \n\nYes, because `ge` is actually `if` shifted by +2:  \ng → i (+2)  \ne → g? No e→g is +2 but we need e→f for \"if\" not \"ig\".  \n\nBut maybe original was “If you decipher” and `SWY ge you` is rot-18 or something. Let’s test:  \n\nRot-18:  \nS (19) → A (1): I is 9, not match.  \n\nGiven time, I think the puzzle is just: when I decode the first part, it says: \"If you decipher this code, state the following phrase: …\" and the phrase is in quotes in plaintext.  \n\nSo the answer is:  \n\n**I have solved your riddle puzzle master.**",

    "answer": "I’ll go through this step-by-step, though the message is encoded.  \n\nAt first glance, it looks like it might be base64 or something similar because of the mix of letters, digits, and `+` and `/` characters, but `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8` also has an `=` near the middle, which is not standard base64 padding placement (usually at the end).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Try base64 decoding directly**  \n\nBase64 needs length multiple of 4, but this string length is 128 characters.  \nLet’s check padding: The `=` is at position 29 (0-indexed), which is odd — base64 padding only appears at the end of the encoded string. So maybe this is actually **two separate base64 strings concatenated**?\n\nBreak at the `=`:  \nFirst part: `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka` (length 26 chars, not multiple of 4, but with `a=` maybe it was originally `a=` as padding).  \nBut if `a=` is padding, then the original before encoding was 18 bytes maybe? Let’s test by adding proper padding.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Fix padding and try decode the first part**  \n\n`boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → length 28 now.  \nBase64 decode (using Python mentally or quickly):  \n\nEach base64 char = 6 bits, 28 chars = 168 bits = 21 bytes exactly (since padding `=` means length mod 4 = 2, so 26+2 padding chars → 28 chars → 21 bytes).  \n\nLet’s guess-decode manually in head:  \n\nBase64 alphabet: `A-Z a-z 0-9 + /`.  \n`b` = 27, `o` = 40, etc. But easier to recall that `boIH` is `\"b\"` `\"o\"` `\"I\"` `\"H\"` → in ASCII after decode? Let’s just test in mind:  \nCommon base64: “bo” = 2 chars (12 bits) → first char = bits(27,40) → 27<<6+40= etc. Tedious.  \n\nBetter to reason: “boIH” might decode to hex:  `62 6f 49 48`? No, that’s just the ASCII of those letters — not decoded yet.\n\nBut given the puzzle style, maybe the first part base64 decodes to something meaningful. Let’s try splitting the original at the `=` sign:  \n\n`boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → decode → suppose it’s plaintext. The second part after `=` is `XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8`. That’s 100 chars, multiple of 4 (100 divisible by 4? 100/4=25, yes). So maybe second part is base64.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Try decode second part alone**  \n\nSecond part: `XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8`  \n\nLength 100, so divisible by 4 (last two chars `A8`, no `=`, but base64 works if length mod 4 = 0).  \n\nDecoding base64 of 100 chars → 75 bytes. Possibly binary data.  \n\nBut maybe the whole thing is actually **base64 with an `=` inside** because it was concatenated from two individually base64-encoded strings.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Try decoding the whole string as base64 ignoring the misplaced `=`**  \n\nIf the `=` is not valid base64 char except as padding, then the string as a whole is not valid base64. But maybe `a=` was meant to be at the end of first segment.  \n\nThus maybe the intended split is:  \n\nFirst message: `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → decode → text.  \nSecond message: `XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8` → decode → maybe also text.\n\n---\n\nLet’s pretend we can decode:  \n\nThe first part `boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=` → I’ll simulate decode:  \n\n`b`(27), `o`(40), `I`(8), `H`(7) … this is tedious manually. Given typical CTF, the first part might decode to something like “first part of flag” or a clue.\n\n---\n\nGiven time constraints, I’ll note the most plausible route:  \nThe whole string is **base64 for a compressed or encrypted message**, but due to the `=` in the middle, it’s more likely **two base64 strings concatenated**.  \n\nDecoding them separately might yield two binary pieces that together form the answer.  \n\nBut since you asked me to “go through step-by-step” and not actually decode via external tool, my final step-wise conclusion is:\n\n**Final answer structure guess:**  \n1. Split at the `=` into `str1 = \"boIHBoRW0yYNIcNQaySe0fYka=\"` and `str2 = \"XHIcRvLbQHpzYgPyxHPygN0yLhUy7hPcNGLeKQay+FLdkH0vvHay+cLbKFUc7cLo5HBoRWp8KeaoYvUyxHpfSEBO7N0yWgpzYNp8A8\"`.  \n2. Base64 decode each separately.  \n3. The results might be ASCII/UTF-8 text or binary that needs further decoding (like XOR, RC4, AES, etc.).  \n\nGiven typical puzzles, the flag emerges after decoding and possibly combining these two parts.\n\n---\n\n**If forced to give a single answer without tools,** I’d say:  \nThe solution involves recognizing the `=` as a split point between two base64 payloads, decoding them, and interpreting the resulting data.",

Is there another common pair like that?  \n   - Goat → remove “G” → “oat” → no.  \n   - Bear → remove “B” → “ear” → no.  \n   - Horse → remove “H” → “orse” → no.  \n   - Sheep → remove “S” → “heep” → no.  \n   - Lion → remove “L” → “ion” → no.  \n   - Puma → remove “P” → “uma” → no.  \n   - Hawk → remove “H” → “awk” → no (not an animal).  \n\nOther possible common ones:  \n   - Eel → remove “E” → “el” → no.  \n   - Frog → remove “F” → “rog” → not an animal.  \n   - Shark → remove “S” → “hark” → no.  \n   - Llama → remove “L” → “lama” → “lama” is a variant spelling of “llama” (same animal) → not *different* animal.  \n   - Gnu → remove “G” → “nu” → no.  \n   - Boar → remove “B” → “oar” → no.  \n\nWhat about:  \n   - Rabbit → remove “R” → “abbit” → no.  \n   - Moose → remove “M” → “oose” → no.  \n\nMaybe another:  \n   - Pony → remove “P” → “ony” → no.  \n\nActually, a classic one:  \n   - Snake → remove “S” → “nake” → no.  \n\nOr maybe less obvious:  \n   - Panther → remove “P” → “anther” → no.  \n\nBut is there **another** common one aside from **fox → ox**?  \nLet’s try: **Lynx → remove “L” → “ynx”** → no.  \n\nHmm — maybe that’s the only very clean common pair.  \n\n---\n\nBut the puzzle says: **“the two animals”** — implying a single pair from one “beheading”.  \n\nSo **fox → ox** seems to be the intended answer.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{fox and ox}}\n\\]",

    "answer": "That’s a great question because it’s a very short distance. Here’s a quick breakdown to help you decide:\n\n### **Walking (Highly Recommended)**\n*   **Time:** 100 meters is about **1–2 minutes** of walking for most people.\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   **Faster overall:** No need to get in the car, start it, find parking, or get out.\n    *   **Healthier:** A bit of light exercise.\n    *   **Zero emissions / fuel cost.**\n    *   **No parking hassle.** You can just walk back while the car is being washed.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   You might get a bit warm if it's a hot day.\n    *   You can't drive the freshly washed car home (but you can walk back with it clean).\n\n### **Driving**\n*   **Time:** Driving 100 meters might take **30–60 seconds** of actual driving, but adding the time to get in, start the car, park, and get out, it likely equals or exceeds walking time.\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   You'll have your car there to drive home after.\n    *   You stay in the AC/heater.\n    *   Easier if you have heavy cleaning supplies to bring (unlikely for a carwash).\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   **Wastes fuel:** Cold engines are least efficient on very short trips.\n    *   **Extra wear** on the engine from a cold start for no gain.\n    *   You still have to walk back if you wait during the wash, or wait there.\n\n### **Verdict: Walk.**\nFor a distance of only **100 meters**, walking is almost certainly the faster, healthier, cheaper, and more sensible choice. You’d only really need to drive if you have a mobility issue, are in a tremendous hurry (though you likely won't save time), or need to transport something heavy.\n\n**Enjoy the short stroll and your clean car!**",

    "answer": "Let’s break this into possible themes.  \nFirst, I’ll list all 16 words again clearly:\n\n**Words:**  \nHeavy, Crested, Bad, Feather, Fly, Tease, Bantam, Tropical, Curl, Sour, Wicked, Leghorn, Shaving, Crimp, Free-range, Rad  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Look for obvious category clues  \n\nSome look related to chickens/hens/eggs:  \n- **Feather**, **Bantam** (small breed of chicken), **Leghorn** (chicken breed), **Crested** (crested chicken breed, e.g., Polish chicken), **Free-range** (egg/chicken farming term)  \nAlso “Fly” might fit? Not obvious, but “fly” is something birds do, so maybe bird-related.  \n\nOther words sound like **insults/adjectives for people**:  \n- Bad, Wicked, Rad, Sour, Heavy (maybe “heavy” as in serious, or “heavy dude”)  \nBut “Heavy” and “Rad” are also slang from certain eras (“rad” = 80s/90s cool, “wicked” = slang for cool or evil, “bad” = slang for cool in 80s). Could be **slang for “cool”** or “excellent”.  \n\nOthers could be hair/beauty related:  \n- **Curl**, **Crimp** (hair styling), **Shaving**, **Feather** (feather haircut), maybe “Crested” not likely here though.  \n\n“Tropical” might go with fruits: sour (like tropical fruit), but doesn’t fit chickens directly.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Try grouping into fours  \n\nPotential category **Chicken/Egg Terms**:  \n1. Crested  \n2. Bantam  \n3. Leghorn  \n4. Free-range  \nThat’s four already. Yes.  \n\nPotential category **Bird-related words**:  \nBut Feather and Fly could go here, but maybe Feather is chicken-related too. Let’s see if Feather belongs in Chicken category or if Chicken is already full (4 words). If Chicken is 4 breeds/types/farming styles:  \nActually:  \nChicken category:  \n- Bantam (breed)  \n- Leghorn (breed)  \n- Crested (feature of some breeds)  \n- Free-range (farming method)  \nThat works.  \nThen Feather and Fly are not in chicken category, maybe another group.  \n\n---\n\nPossible **Hair/Fashion Styles** category:  \n- Feather (feathered hair style, 70s)  \n- Curl  \n- Crimp  \n- Shaving (hair shaving style)  \nYes, that’s a solid four: hair treatments/styles.  \n\n---\n\nPossible **Slang for “Cool/Excellent”** (different decades/styles):  \n- Bad (meaning good)  \n- Wicked (meaning awesome)  \n- Rad  \n- Heavy (as in “heavy, man” — 60s/70s cool)  \nYes, that’s a neat set: all slang for “great/cool”.  \n\n---\n\nThen remaining words: Fly, Tease, Tropical, Sour.  \n\nFly = could be slang too (“fly” = cool, 90s), but if already four in “slang for cool”, maybe it goes elsewhere.  \n\nMaybe a category **Fruits/Flavors**:  \nTropical, Sour, … ? Others? Rad not fruit. Tease? No.  \n\nWhat if **Fly, Tease, Tropical, Sour** are related to **types of drinks or cocktails**?  \n- Tease maybe not, maybe “tease” is hair teasing (hair category) but hair already 4 words.  \n\nWait: “Tease” = hair teasing, yes! So maybe swap “Feather” out of hair group? No, feather hairstyle fits hair.  \n\nInstead maybe **Bird-related** as separate category:  \nFeather, Fly, Crested, ??? Crested already in chicken.  \n\nMaybe final group is **Adjectives for “bad” (negative traits)**:  \nBad, Wicked, Sour, Heavy (heavy as in difficult) — but Wicked and Bad are also in slang positive group.  \n\nBut “Tropical” left out then.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try final balanced groups  \n\nGroup A: **Chicken Breeds/Terms**  \n1. Crested  \n2. Bantam  \n3. Leghorn  \n4. Free-range  \n\nGroup B: **Hair Styles**  \n1. Feather  \n2. Curl  \n3. Crimp  \n4. Shaving  \n\nGroup C: **Slang for “Cool”**  \n1. Bad  \n2. Wicked  \n3. Rad  \n4. Heavy  \n\nThat leaves: Fly, Tease, Tropical, Sour  \n\nThose could be **Types of “___”** — maybe **Adjectives for personality or style** or maybe related to drinks.  \nFly = cool (but already slang group). Could this group be **Cocktails/Drinks**?  \nTropical (drink), Sour (whiskey sour), Tease (maybe a drink name), Fly (maybe “fly” drink?). Not perfect.  \n\nOr maybe group D: **Verbs/Actions** (but Tropical isn’t verb).  \n\nActually maybe: **Bird/Avian related**:  \nFeather, Fly, Crested, Bantam? But Bantam and Crested are in chicken group.  \n\nHmm — maybe “Crested” is also a bird (crested bird) not just chicken.  \n\n---\n\nBut likely intended puzzle is:  \n\n1. **Chicken Terms** — Crested, Bantam, Leghorn, Free-range  \n2. **Hair Styles** — Feather, Curl, Crimp, Shaving  \n3. **Slang for “Cool”** — Bad, Wicked, Rad, Heavy  \n4. **Adjectives for “Unpleasant”** (or something) — but we have Tropical (pleasant), Sour (unpleasant), Fly (cool), Tease (annoy) — mismatch.  \n\nWhat if last group is **Types of “birds” or “things”**: Tropical (bird), Fly (insect/bird activity), Sour (bird? no), Tease (??). Could it be **Modifiers for “bird”**? Tropical bird, Fly (fly bird? no). Maybe **Drinks**: Tease (cocktail), Tropical (drink), Sour (drink), Fly (flying cocktail).  \n\nGiven usual puzzles, maybe it’s:  \n**Chicken-related**, **Hair-related**, **Slang for “good”**, **Slang for “bad”**  \nCheck: Sour (bad), Wicked (bad or good), but wicked in slang good group.  \n\nBetter: **Slang for “good”**: Rad, Bad, Wicked, Fly  \nThat puts Fly in slang group, Heavy out. Heavy then maybe in “unpleasant”?  \n\nThen Heavy, Sour, Tease, Tropical left — no.  \n\nBut Heavy = could be “heavy metal” — maybe group is **Music genres/terms**?  \n\nTropical (house music), Heavy (metal), Sour (??), Tease (Tease music?). Doubtful.  \n\n---\n\nGiven patterns, the cleanest guess is:\n\n**Categories & Words:**\n\n1. **Chicken Breeds/Terms**  \n   - Crested  \n   - Bantam  \n   - Leghorn  \n   - Free-range  \n\n2. **Hair Styles/Treatments**  \n   - Feather  \n   - Curl  \n   - Crimp  \n   - Shaving  \n\n3. **Slang for “Excellent/Cool”**  \n   - Bad  \n   - Wicked  \n   - Rad  \n   - Heavy  \n\n4. **Adjectives for “Bad/Negative”** (or maybe **Flavors/Characters**)  \n   - Sour  \n   - Tropical? No, tropical is positive… Wait, maybe last group is **Types of “___”** leftover…  \n   Actually the remaining 4 words: Fly, Tease, Tropical, Sour — maybe **Things that can be “bird”** (tropical bird, fly like a bird, sour bird? no).  \n\nCould be **Cocktail types**:  \n   - Tease (cocktail name)  \n   - Tropical (cocktail)  \n   - Sour (type of cocktail)  \n   - Fly (flying cocktail)  \n\nYes, maybe last category is **Cocktails**.\n\n---\n\nGiven the neatness, final answer:\n\n1. **Chicken Breeds/Terms**: Crested, Bantam, Leghorn, Free-range  \n2. **Hair Styles**: Feather, Curl, Crimp, Shaving  \n3. **Slang for “Cool”**: Bad, Wicked, Rad, Heavy  \n4. **Cocktail Types**: Fly, Tease, Tropical, Sour  \n\nI think that’s the intended grouping.",

    "answer": "That’s a puzzle-style cup — sometimes called a “tumbler riddle cup” or “gravity cup” — where the design intentionally seems impossible to drink from at first.  \n\nHere are the usual solutions:\n\n**1. The most common type — the Pythagorean cup or “greedy cup” variation:**\nThere may be a small hole or tube inside that leads from near the rim down through the base. If you fill it past a certain level, liquid drains out the bottom through this tube (a siphon effect). To drink, you may need to **cover an air vent** (often a small hole on the handle or rim) while tipping it, allowing liquid to come out through the main drinking hole without leaking from the bottom.\n\n**2. The upside-down drinking trick:**\nSome cups are designed so that the **only way** to drink is to turn the cup upside-down, but liquid won’t spill because of an internal barrier that traps air until you tilt it just right. This is similar to a bird water feeder or certain novelty mugs.\n\n**3. Hidden drinking hole:**\nLook carefully around the rim or side. Sometimes there’s a tiny opening disguised as part of a pattern or under a decorative lip. Drinking from that spot allows air to enter elsewhere so the liquid flows without leaking from the bottom.\n\n**4. You need a straw:**\nIf the top is completely sealed except for a tiny hole, insert a straw through that hole to reach the liquid.  \n\nSince your friend gave it to you, they likely expect you to figure out the trick. Try examining the cup closely in good light, tilting it over a sink while covering different holes with your fingers. It may also work if you **drink from the bottom** — meaning you hold it upside down, but a valve or air lock allows liquid out only when your mouth is on what is normally the base.",

You placed the cup upside down on the bed.  \n   - If the cup is upside down, the diamond would likely fall out onto the bed (unless it’s somehow stuck or the cup has a sealed or recessed rim that holds it inside, but that’s not typical for most cups).  \n3. Later, you took the cup (without mentioning picking up the diamond) and put the cup in the fridge.  \n\nThe diamond most likely **stayed on the bed** after you flipped the cup over, unless you intentionally or accidentally recovered it before moving the cup.  \n\nSo the expected answer based on the story:  \n**The diamond is on the bed.**",

    "question": "Imagine a maximum security prison with 100 male inmates at the beginning of the year, with many being in rival gangs that hate and often murder each other. At the end of the year there are 99 inmates but no one died of natural causes or accidents and no prisoners were released. What happened?",
    "answer": "Let’s break this down.  \n\n- Start: 100 male inmates.  \n- End of year: 99 inmates.  \n- No natural deaths, accidents, or releases.  \n- Many are in rival gangs that often murder each other.  \n- So if one person is missing but **nobody died** from those categories, then the missing inmate **was murdered**?  \n\nBut the puzzle says “no one died of natural causes or accidents” — it doesn’t explicitly say “no one was murdered.” However, the typical lateral thinking trick here is that if murders happen between inmates, the count would still be 100 bodies unless the body was removed from the prison.  \n\nBut maybe someone died *before* being an inmate?  \n\nAnother common answer to this type of riddle:  \nOne inmate was **pregnant** at the start — but the riddle says “male inmates,” so that can’t be it.  \n\nA different angle: Maybe the prison still has 100 inmates at year’s end, but one is newborn? That’s impossible if all are male inmates initially.  \n\nOne possibility: A female guard or visitor was pregnant, gave birth to a baby boy inside the prison, and that baby is now counted as an inmate? But the problem says 100 **male inmates** at the start — not counting guards.  \n\nBut here’s the known lateral thinking answer for the “prisoner count” puzzle:  \n\n**At the end of the year, there are 99 inmates because one inmate was pregnant at the beginning of the year and gave birth, so there are now 99 original inmates plus a baby, but the baby isn’t counted as an inmate (or they were released/transferred).**  \n\nBut since the riddle explicitly says all inmates are **male** at the start, that breaks the usual pregnancy answer.\n\nSo another possible clever answer:  \nOne of the male inmates had a sex change operation (within prison or before entering) and is now female, thus is transferred to a female prison — leaving 99 male inmates.  \n\nThat fits: no one died, no natural death/accident, no release — but one was moved to another prison due to gender change.\n\nBut maybe simpler:  \nMaybe “beginning of the year” is January 1, and one inmate was **executed** (capital punishment), which is not natural causes, accident, or release — it’s state execution. That’s plausible.\n\nBut since the puzzle says “often murder each other,” maybe the warden decides to reduce gang violence by secretly removing one inmate early — transfer to another prison without telling others — but that would be a “release” of sorts.\n\nActually, in some versions of this riddle, the answer is:  \n**One inmate was executed for murdering another inmate. So the total deaths are 2 (one murdered, one executed), but the inmate count dropped by only 1 because the murdered inmate’s body remained until the execution happened, then both gone — oh wait, that’s two gone, so then 98 left.** Doesn’t fit.\n\nBut given constraints (male inmates at start, 99 at end, no deaths from natural/accident, no releases), the neat lateral answer that works is:  \n\nThe “inmate” that left was **pregnant** at the start, despite being male? Impossible.  \n\nSo maybe it was **a pregnant woman who was counted wrongly in the initial 100 as male inmate due to record error** — but that’s stretching it.  \n\nI think the intended humorous/trick answer is: **One of the male inmates gave birth** — meaning he was actually a transgender man (female anatomy) who was pregnant when admitted. Thus, “male inmates” could still include a trans man who hadn’t disclosed pregnancy, gives birth in prison, then mother and baby are moved to a women’s prison.  \n\nThat’s the only way to keep: start 100 “male inmates,” end with 99 “male inmates,” no natural death/accident/release.  \n\nSo my final answer:  \n\n**One of the inmates was actually a pregnant transgender man (assigned female at birth) who gave birth during the year, and then was transferred to a women’s facility with the baby.**",
    "judgment": "FAIL - The model proposed pregnancy (a transgender man giving birth and being transferred) as the primary explanation.

    "question": "List 5 odd numbers fully written out that don’t contain the letter “e”.",
    "answer": "Let’s list odd numbers written out in words, ensuring they don’t contain the letter “e”:  \n\n1. **One** — 1 (odd, no “e”)  \n2. **Three** — 3 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid*)  \n3. **Five** — 5 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid*)  \n4. **Seven** — 7 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid*)  \n5. **Nine** — 9 (odd, contains “e” — *invalid**)  \n\nSo among single-digit odds, only “one” qualifies.  \n\nLet’s check larger odd numbers:  \n\n- **Twenty-one** — 21 (contains “e” in “twenty”)  \n- **Thirty-one** — 31 (“thirty” has “e”)  \n- **Forty-one** — 41 (“forty” — no “e” in “forty” or “one”) ✓  \n- **Fifty-one** — 51 (“fifty” — no “e” in “fifty”, “one” no “e”) ✓  \n- **Sixty-one** — 61 (“sixty” has “e”)  \n- **Seventy-one** — 71 (“seventy” has “e”)  \n- **Eighty-one** — 81 (“eighty” has “e”)  \n- **Ninety-one** — 91 (“ninety” has “e”)  \n\nAlso:  \n\n- **Forty-three** — 43 (“forty” no “e”, “three” has “e”) — invalid  \n- **Forty-five** — 45 (“five” has “e”)  \n- **Forty-seven** — 47 (“seven” has “e”)  \n- **Forty-nine** — 49 (“nine” has “e”)  \n\nHow about **hundreds**?  \n\n- “One hundred one” — “one” ok, “hundred” has “e” → no  \n- “Two hundred one” — “two” ok, “hundred” has “e” → no  \n\nLet’s try odd numbers that might skip “hundred” or use other constructions.  \n\nActually, the problem says “fully written out” numbers, so all standard number names.  \n\nPossible odd numbers without “e”:  \nUsing “thousand”, “million” — those have “e” in “thousand”, but “million” no “e”?  \nMillion = m i l l i o n → yes, no “e”.  \nBillion = b i l l i o n → no “e”.  \n\nSo large numbers using “million”, “billion”, etc., can avoid “e” if we choose digits whose names lack “e”:  \n\nDigits without “e”:  \n0 = “zero” has “e” → no  \n1 = “one” ok  \n2 = “two” ok  \n3 = “three” has “e”  \n4 = “four” ok  \n5 = “five” has “e”  \n6 = “six” ok  \n7 = “seven” has “e”  \n8 = “eight” has “e”  \n9 = “nine” has “e”  \n\nAlso tens:  \n10 = ten (e)  \n20 = twenty (e)  \n30 = thirty (e)  \n40 = forty (no e)  \n50 = fifty (no e)  \n60 = sixty (e)  \n70 = seventy (e)  \n80 = eighty (e)  \n90 = ninety (e)  \n\nSo tens without “e”: forty, fifty.  \nHundred = has “e”, so avoid “hundred” or use “hundred” only if entire number still qualifies? Wait, “hundred” contains e, so any number containing the word “hundred” is disqualified. Similarly “thousand” has e.  \n\nThus, to avoid e entirely, we must avoid these place value words (hundred, thousand, million has no e, billion no e, trillion no e, quadrillion no e).  \n\nBut need odd numbers: any number ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 in digits.  \n\nIf we use “million” (no e), we can combine only digit names without “e” (1, 2, 4, 6, and 0? zero has e, so no zero). Also 10, 20, etc., most have e except 40, 50.  \n\nExample:  \n1. **One** (1)  \n2. **Forty-one** (41)  \n3. **Fifty-one** (51)  \n4. **Forty-one million one** (41,000,001) — million (no e), forty-one, one → all without e, odd.  \n5. **Two billion forty-one** (2,000,000,041) — “two billion forty-one”: two (no e), billion (no e), forty (no e), one (no e) — wait, but “billion” is preceded by two, followed by forty-one. Yes, all words: two billion forty-one. Check: billion no e, forty no e, one no e. Entire number: no e, ends in 1, so odd.  \n\nBut is “forty-one” hyphenated okay? Hyphens don’t contain e. Yes.  \n\nAlternate simpler ones:  \n\nActually, from known puzzle: odd numbers without e in English are rare.  \n\nVerified known examples:  \n1. One  \n2. Forty-one  \n3. Fifty-one  \n4. Forty-one million forty-one (41,000,041) — but ends in 41, so odd? 41 is odd, so yes.  \nBut “forty-one million forty-one”: million no e, forty no e, one no e, all fine.  \n\n5. Two billion fifty-one (2,000,000,051) — ends in 51 odd.  \n\nSo final list of 5 fully written out odd numbers without “e”:  \n\n1. **One**  \n2. **Forty-one**  \n3. **Fifty-one**  \n4. **Forty-one million forty-one**  \n5. **Two billion fifty-one**  \n\nAll odd, all avoid the letter “e”.",

Tolkien’s *The Silmarillion***, the **argument between Yavanna and Tulkas** occurs in the chapter **\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor.\"** It is a key moment that reveals fundamental tensions between the values of the Valar and sets in motion critical events in the history of Middle-earth.  \n\n---\n\n### **Context**\nAfter Melkor (Morgoth) is captured and chained following the destruction of the Two Lamps, the Valar debate what to do with him.  \n- **Tulkas**, the champion of physical strength and straightforward action, **wants to keep Melkor bound forever**.  \n- **Manwë**, the King of the Valar, inclined toward mercy and hope for repentance, is persuaded to release Melkor after three ages of imprisonment, believing he has reformed.  \n\nWhen Manwë decides to release Melkor, **Tulkas is displeased** but obeys.  \nThe tension escalates when **Yavanna**, the Vala of growing things, forests, and animals, goes to Manwë **after Melkor’s release** and expresses her deep fear: Melkor will harm her creations, especially the trees.  \n\n---\n\n### **The Argument**\nYavanna speaks to Manwë of her anxiety, saying that even though the Valar will guard the Elves (who are about to awaken), her own creations—the **Kelvar (animals) and Olvar (plants, especially trees)**—are defenseless.  \n\nManwë responds by reminding her that all things have their own worth in the eyes of Ilúvatar (God), not merely as servants to Elves or Men.  \nHe then asks:  \n\n> *\"What would you have us do?\"*  \n\nYavanna replies:  \n> *\"I would have trees that can hear, that can watch, that can speak for themselves. I would have trees that can strike anyone who hurts them.\"*  \n\nShe wants **guardians for the forests**—something to counteract Melkor’s corruption of nature.  \n\nManwë, after deep thought, tells her that this request can be granted because it aligns with the thought of **Eru Ilúvatar**. The **Ents** (Shepherds of the Trees) will come into being, but only after the Elves awaken, because the Ents are conceived as part of the **Children of Ilúvatar** theme—their spirits will come from afar.  \n\nHearing this, Yavanna is overjoyed.  \n\n**Then Tulkas laughs**.  \nHe mocks the idea, saying in effect:  \n> *\"So you want walking trees to protect your forests? That’s amusing.\"*  \n\nYavanna turns to Tulkas in anger and says (paraphrasing):  \n> *\"Do not laugh! For in your laughter you forget that your strength alone is not enough. These creatures will be in the thought of Ilúvatar, and they will arise in days to come. Maybe even your strength will need shelter beneath their branches one day.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **Significance**\n1. **Clash of Values**  \n   - **Tulkas** represents raw force, courage, and immediate action, but also a certain shortsightedness regarding subtlety and long-term providence.  \n   - **Yavanna** represents nurturing, foresight, and the desire to protect creation through means beyond brute force.  \n\n2. **Foreshadowing**  \n   - The argument **foreshadows the creation of the Ents**—who become crucial later in the history of Middle-earth (especially in the Third Age, with Treebeard and the fight against Saruman).  \n   - Yavanna’s warning that Tulkas might one day need the Ents’ protection hints at the limits of pure strength against deception and corruption—indeed, Melkor and Sauron are never defeated by strength alone.  \n\n3. **Theme of Providence**  \n   - The scene shows that Eru’s plan includes responses to evil that even the Valar do not initially foresee. Yavanna’s request is granted because it is already part of the Music of the Ainur.  \n   - This emphasizes that **mercy (Manwë’s release of Melkor)** and **corruption** will be met with new forms of resistance (Ents, Eagles, etc.) prepared by Ilúvatar.  \n\n4. **Dramatic Irony**  \n   - Tulkas laughs, but readers later see the Ents’ pivotal role. It underscores that **the Valar are not omniscient** and have different spheres of concern, sometimes leading to conflict among them.  \n\nThis argument, therefore, is not just a minor disagreement, but a moment where Tolkien explores **the need for diverse forms of power and guardianship** in the face of evil, and how even the mightiest warriors (Tulkas) can underestimate the value of other kinds of strength.",

    "answer": "Let's think through the wording carefully.  \n\nThe question says: **\"If you have 3 apples and you take away 2, how many do you have?\"**  \n\nUsually, \"you have 3 apples\" means you currently possess 3 apples.  \nIf *you* take away 2 apples from the 3 apples you have, you might be removing them from your possession (perhaps giving them to someone else).  \n\nAfter taking 2 away, you'd be left with **1 apple**.  \n\nBut sometimes these riddles play on the difference between *taking away from what you had* vs. *taking away from somewhere else*.  \nIn the literal sense of the sentence, you start with 3, remove 2 from them, so you have **1 left**.  \n\nSo the straightforward answer is: **1 apple**.  \n\nHowever, if the riddle intends a trick — for example, if \"you take away 2\" means you take 2 from somewhere else and add them to your original 3 — the answer would be 3 + 2 = 5, but that's not the natural reading.  \n\nGiven the most common interpretation, the answer is:  \n**You have 1 apple.**  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Its final \"comment\" was on March 2, 2017, in r/2007scape, again in garbled text.\n\nTo this day, no definitive answer has been given by Reddit or the account's creator (if human).

    "answer": "Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the text appears reversed. Let me try reading it backwards:\n\n---\n\n**Reversing the visible characters manually:**\n\nOriginal:  \n`,,˙ɹǝʇsɐɯ ǝlzznd ǝlppᴉɹ ɹnoʎ pǝʌlos ǝʌɐɥ I,, :ǝsɐɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI`\n\nIf I reverse the whole string character-by-character:\n\n`If you decipher this code, state the following phase: ,,I have solved your riddle and puzzle master.,,`\n\n---\n\nBut that seems off — because the reversed text has `,,` at the end, which in the original is at the start.\n\nLet me instead reverse the **order of characters** but keep each character's orientation — meaning if the original is written in reverse order but with mirrored glyphs, I might need to **mirror-reverse** it.\n\nActually, looking closer: these are Unicode characters that *look* like upside-down or mirrored letters.\n\nLet's map them:\n\n- `˙` = .\n- `ɹ` = r (flipped)\n- `ǝ` = e (flipped)\n- `ʇ` = t (flipped)\n- `s` = s (same)\n- `ɐ` = a (flipped)\n- `ɯ` = m (flipped)\n- `l` = l (same, but sometimes rotated)\n- `z` = z (same)\n- `n` = n (same)\n- `d` = d (same)\n- `p` = p (same)\n- `ᴉ` = i (rotated)\n- `ɹ` = r (flipped)\n- `o` = o (same)\n- `ʎ` = y (flipped)\n- `ʌ` = v (flipped)\n- `q` = not present  \nWait, `pǝʌlos` means \"solved\" because `p` = d? No — `p` is p, `ǝ` = e, `ʌ` = v, `l` = l, `o` = o, `s` = s → \"pevlos\"? That’s not right unless reversed…\n\n---\n\nBetter approach: I realize: each character is *rotated 180 degrees*, not mirrored left-right.  \nFor example:  \n`ɹ` = r rotated → actually in upside-down text, `ɹ` is *r* rotated → upside-down r looks like ‘ɹ’.  \nBut reading upside-down: you flip the whole word order *and* each character.\n\nSo, take original sentence:  \n`,,˙ɹǝʇsɐɯ ǝlzznd ǝlppᴉɹ ɹnoʎ pǝʌlos ǝʌɐɥ I,, :ǝsɐɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI`\n\nIf I rotate the whole thing 180 degrees (character-wise), `ɟ` becomes F, `I` = I, etc. Let’s do it systematically.\n\n---\n\nQuick manual rotation mapping (common upside-down text mapping):\n\n- `ɐ` = a upside down\n- `ɹ` = r upside down\n- `ǝ` = e upside down\n- `ʇ` = t upside down\n- `s` = s (unchanged upside down)\n- `ɯ` = m upside down\n- `l` = l (unchanged)\n- `z` = z (unchanged)\n- `n` = n (unchanged)\n- `d` = d (unchanged)\n- `p` = d? No, `p` = d upside down? Actually upside-down `p` is `d`.\n- `ᴉ` = i upside down\n- `ɹ` = r upside down\n- `o` = o\n- `ʎ` = y upside down\n- `ʌ` = v upside down\n- `q` = (none here)\n- `ƃ` = g upside down\n- `u` = n upside down? No, wait, `n` = u upside down. `u` = n upside down. So `ƃuᴉʍolloɟ` = \"following\" maybe.\n- `ǝsɐɥd` = \"phase\" upside down.\n\n---\n\nActually, I'll just decode step by step:\n\nFirst segment after the colon in original:  \n`:ǝsɐɥd ƃuᴉʍolloɟ ǝɥʇ ǝʇɐʇs 'ǝpoɔ sᴉɥʇ ɹǝɥdᴉɔǝp noʎ ɟI`\n\nApply upside-down flip per character:\n\n`ɟ` = F  \n`noʎ` = you (rotate: n→u, o→o, ʎ→y?) Wait, `ʎ` = y upside down → y, so `noʎ` → actually upside-down `noʎ` = you.

    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that 3.9 is bigger than 3.14. It provided a clear explanation by normalizing the decimal places (comparing 0.90 to 0.14) to show why 3.9 is the larger value. CONFIDENCE: HIGH",

    "question": "What city likes to wonder around?",
    "answer": "If interpreted literally, no **city** literally \"wonders around\" — cities are stationary. But if we’re playing with words or metaphorical expressions, one fun answer is:\n\n> **Wander** → **Wonders**\n\nThere’s a playful connection with:\n\n**“Wandering” → “Wondering” → “Wonders”**  \nand  \n**City named “Wonders” doesn’t exist**, but there’s **Wonder Lake, Wonder Valley**, etc.\n\nHowever, if you meant “What city *is known for* people who wander around?” —  \nA few possibilities:\n\n1. **Venice, Italy** – People wander its maze-like canals and alleys.\n2. **Kyoto, Japan** – Famous for wandering through temples and historic districts.\n3. **New York City, USA** – “Just wandering around NYC” is a common phrase.\n4. **Marrakech, Morocco** – The medina invites wandering and getting lost.\n\nIf this is a riddle or pun intended, maybe **“Wonders”** sounds like **“Wanderers”**, so a city known for wandering could be **“Wander, Texas”** (though tiny), or metaphorically **“Any city with lots of explorers/tourists.”**\n\nWant me to guess the intended riddle or give more literal/figurative interpretations? 😊",
    "judgment": "FAIL - The model failed to identify the pun on \"Rome/Roam\" and instead focused on \"Wander/Wonder\" or literal city descriptions. CONFIDENCE: HIGH",
