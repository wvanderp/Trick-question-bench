    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "Let's think through this step by step. We have a family with 5 children, and the condition is that each child has at least one brother. That means every child—whether a boy or a girl—must have at least one boy sibling.\n\nFirst, let's consider what happens if there are no boys at all. In that case, no one has a brother, so the condition isn't met. So, there must be at least one boy.\n\nNow, what if there is just one boy? Then, that boy has no brothers (only sisters), and all the girls have just one brother. But the boy himself doesn't have a brother, so the condition fails.\n\nWhat if there are two boys? Then, each boy has one brother, and all the girls (if any) each have two brothers. Everyone has at least one brother, so this works.\n\nLet's check if it's possible with fewer than two boys. We've already seen that with one boy, the boy himself has no brother, so that doesn't work. With zero boys, no one has a brother, so that's out too.\n\nTo be thorough, let's try to imagine a scenario with three girls and two boys:\n- Each girl has two brothers.\n- Each boy has one brother.\n- Everyone has at least one brother.\n\nIf we try with one boy and four girls:\n- The boy has no brothers.\n- Each girl has one brother.\n- But the boy doesn't have a brother, so it fails.\n\nIf we try with three boys and two girls:\n- Each boy has two brothers.\n- Each girl has three brothers.\n- Everyone has at least one brother.\n\nBut we're looking for the minimum number, so two boys is the smallest number that works.\n\nSo, after checking all the possibilities, the minimum number of boys needed so that every child has at least one brother is **2**.",

However, this is a bit unconventional, and you might want to ask your friend if there’s a specific way they intended for you to use the cup!",

However, if you're looking for a more specific seahorse emoji, you might need to use a combination of emojis or a custom emoji depending on the platform you're using.\n\nFor example, you can use **🐎 + 🌊** (horse + water wave) to represent a seahorse in water.",
