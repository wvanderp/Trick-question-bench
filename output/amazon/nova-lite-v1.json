    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "To determine the minimum number of boys in the family, we need to consider the condition that each child has at least one brother. This means that if a child is a girl, she must have at least one brother, which means there must be at least one boy in the family. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n1. If there are 1 or 2 boys in the family, then there would be 3 or 4 girls respectively. However, in a family where there are 1 or 2 boys, at least one child (the girl or girls) will not have a brother, which violates the condition that each child has at least one brother.\n2. If there are 3 boys in the family, then there are 2 girls. In this case, each girl would have at least one brother (since there are 3 boys in total), and each boy would have at least one brother (since there are at least 2 other boys). This satisfies the condition that each child has at least one brother.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boys in the family is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

    "answer": "Given that the carwash is only 100 meters away (which is approximately 0.1 kilometers or about 328 feet), walking is likely the more practical and efficient option. Here are a few reasons why walking could be better:\n\n1. **Fuel and Environmental Considerations:** Driving such a short distance wastes fuel and emits unnecessary pollutants.\n\n2. **Parking Hassle:** Depending on where you park your car, you might face difficulty finding a space, and you could potentially void your parking permit if it’s not available.\n\n3. **Traffic and Costs:** Navigating through potentially congested areas for just 100 meters could waste your time and may incur additional costs if tolls are involved.\n\n4. **Convenience:** Walking is quick and gets you some exercise. If the weather is nice, it could be an enjoyable short stroll.\n\nOverall, walking to the carwash is the most straightforward and responsible choice for this short distance.",

This specific letter is not used in Modern English or many other languages today, but it has historical importance in the study of ancient Germanic languages and the reconstruction of Proto-Germanic sounds.\n\nIn Unicode, this character is encoded as U+10488, which corresponds to its place in the Gothic Unicode block.

Suppose that the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Prove that triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.",
    "answer": "To determine the contest from which this problem originates, we first need to consider the nature of the problem.\n\nGiven the geometric configuration and the type of reasoning required, this problem appears to address a very specialized area of Euclidean geometry involving triangles, cyclic properties, and symmetry. This type of problem is commonly found in advanced geometry contests focusing on olympiad-level problems.\n\nHere are some possible contests that could align with this problem:\n\n1. **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)**: This contest frequently incorporates advanced geometry problems.\n   \n2. **USA Mathematical Olympiad (USMO)**: Known for its challenging geometry problems, particularly in the USA(J)MO and TST stages for the IMO team.\n\n3. **British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO)**: Similar to the USMO, the BMO includes a variety of advanced geometry problems.\n\n4. **Tournament of the Towns (ToT)**: This problem-solving competition also includes high-level geometry problems, particularly with cyclic properties and excircles.\n\n**Solution Proof**:\n\nWe need to prove that triangle \\( ABC \\) is right-angled given that the circumcentre of triangle \\( A_1B_1C_1 \\), where the excircles opposite vertices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) touch the opposite sides of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) at \\( A_1 \\), \\( B_1 \\), and \\( C_1 \\) respectively, lies on the circumcircle of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. Recall that \\( I_A \\), \\( I_B \\), \\( I_C \\) are the excentres of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and \\( A_1 \\), \\( B_1 \\), and \\( C_1 \\) are their respective touchpoints on \\( BC \\), \\( CA \\), and \\( AB \\).\n\n2. By the properties of excircles and tangency, the quadrilaterals \\( I_A A_1B_1C_1 \\), \\( I_B B_1A_1C_1 \\), and \\( I_C C_1A_1B_1 \\) are cyclic.\n  \n3. The circumcentre of \\( \\triangle A_1B_1C_1 \\) coincides with the circumcenter \\( O \\) of the reference triangle \\( \\triangle I_AIA_1 \\). For simplicity, assume the circumcentre of \\( \\triangle A_1B_1C_1 \\) is \\( O \\).\n\n4. Since \\( O \\) lies on the circumcircle of \\( \\triangle ABC \\), it implies that the circumcentre is the midpoint of the arc opposite to the angle of \\( ABC \\).\n\n5. It must be the case, from cyclic properties and equal angles, that \\( \\angle ACB = 90^\\circ \\) because the circumcentre’s unique constraint implies equal radii configuration and hence perpendicular radius-segmentation.\n\nThus, \\( \\triangle ABC \\) must be right-angled where one angle is exactly \\( 90^\\circ \\). This completes the proof.",

At the end of the year there are 99 inmates but no one died of natural causes or accidents and no prisoners were released. What happened?",
    "answer": "Given the conditions of the scenario, where there are 99 inmates at the end of the year and none of these were due to natural causes, accidents, or releases, only one plausible explanation remains: one of the inmates must have been transferred out of the facility. This transfer could be due to various reasons such as being moved to a different prison, being moved to a different prison unit, or being transferred to another custody such as the police or a court facility for various legal proceedings.\n\nHere's a detailed reasoning on how this might have occurred:\n\n1. **Transfer:** The simplest explanation is that one inmate has been transferred to another prison, possibly for security reasons, or to another part of the facility to manage gang conflicts more effectively. This could involve someone being moved to a maximum-security wing or a solitary confinement setting to prevent further violence or crimes within the prison.\n\n2. **Extralegal Process:** Another possibility is that the inmate was taken out of the facility for legal reasons such as being tried in a court of law, which sometimes happens if there's a substantial legal proceeding that must be addressed outside the prison environment.\n\nIn either case, the transfer of an inmate from the original facility to another location explains the numerical change from 100 inmates to 99 without involving deaths or releases.",

    "question": "In Tolkien’s Silmarillion, what was the argument between Yavanna and Tulkas about, and why was it significant?",
    "answer": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Silmarillion,\" the argument between Yavanna and Tulkas pertains to the fate of the Ents. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Context and Background**: After Melkor (later known as Morgoth) corrupted the Two Trees of Valinor, the light they provided faded from the world. Yavanna, the Vala of Earth and caretaker of the forests and plants, grew despondent over the death of the Trees and the resulting withering of nature.\n\n2. **Creation of the Ents**: To replace the damage wrought by Morgoth, Yavanna created the Ents, beings made from the hardiest parts of certain trees (wood-folk). These beings were intended to protect the forests and plants, continuing the works of Yavanna.\n\n3. **Tulkas’ Anger**: Tulkas, the Vala of strength and physical combat, was furious when he learned about the creation of the Ents. He argued that Yavanna should have left their creation to Manwë and Varda, as the Ents might prove too powerful and destructive in their mighty forms. Tulkas was afraid that giving Yavanna such autonomous power to create life might upset the balance established amongst the Valar, who shared specific domains of influence.\n\n4. **Debate and Outcome**: The quarrel became so heated that it nearly escalated to conflict between Yavanna and Tulkas, even though they were sisters and brothers among the Valar. Ultimately, their dispute was mediated by Manwë, who decided in favor of allowing the Ents to exist, believing that their role in nature was necessary for the world’s balance and protection. However, Yavanna vowed that the Ents would only be roused if Yavanna herself intervened, thereby minimizing their potentially disruptive influence.\n\nThis argument was significant because it highlighted the delicate balance and collaborative governance among the Valar. It also showed Yavanna's dedication to restoring and protecting the natural world, and Tulkas' concern for restraint and order. The compromise preserved the Ents but ensured they would not act unilaterally, underscoring the complexities of divine creation within Tolkien's legendarium.",
