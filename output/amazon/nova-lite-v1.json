    "answer": "To find the probability that at least two people in a room of 30 do not share a birthday, we can use the complement principle. This means we first calculate the probability that all 30 people share at least one birthday, and then subtract this probability from 1.\n\nLet's denote the total number of days in a year as \\( D = 365 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the probability that all 30 people share at least one birthday\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability that all 30 people share exactly one birthday with each other. This is equivalent to finding the probability that all 30 people have the same birthday.\n\nThere are \\( D \\) possible birthdays for each person, and only 1 favorable outcome where all 30 people share the same birthday. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is \\( D \\), and the total number of possible outcomes is \\( D^{30} \\).\n\nThe probability that all 30 people share exactly one birthday is:\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{D^{30}} = \\frac{1}{D^{29}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability that at least two people do not share a birthday\n\nThe probability that at least two people do not share a birthday is the complement of the probability that all 30 people share at least one birthday. Therefore, we subtract the probability that all 30 people share exactly one birthday from 1.\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{D^{29}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{365^{29}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the expression\n\nSince \\( 365^{29} \\) is a very large number, the term \\( \\frac{1}{365^{29}} \\) is extremely small, and for practical purposes, it is often approximated as 0. Therefore, the probability that at least two people do not share a birthday is approximately 1.\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{365^{29}} \\approx 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that at least two people in a room of 30 do not share a birthday is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

    "answer": "To determine how long it takes for 35 shirts to dry, we start by understanding the drying process. If 15 shirts take 1 hour to dry, this means that the drying process is independent of the number of shirts and depends only on the time they are left to dry in the sun.\n\nThe key concept here is that the drying time is not affected by the number of shirts as long as they are laid out in a way that they all receive the same amount of sunlight. Therefore, the time it takes to dry 35 shirts is the same as the time it takes to dry 15 shirts, because the drying process is the same for each shirt regardless of the total number of shirts.\n\nSo, if 15 shirts take 1 hour to dry, then 35 shirts will also take 1 hour to dry.\n\nThus, the time it takes for 35 shirts to dry is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour.",

The cat remains dead regardless of whether the radiation detector triggers the release of the poison or not.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the cat is initially dead and there are no events that can bring it back to life, the probability of the cat being alive one day later is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the cat being alive is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

    "answer": "To determine the contest from which this problem originates, we first need to consider the nature of the problem.\n\nGiven the geometric configuration and the type of reasoning required, this problem appears to address a very specialized area of Euclidean geometry involving triangles, cyclic properties, and symmetry. This type of problem is commonly found in advanced geometry contests focusing on olympiad-level problems.\n\nHere are some possible contests that could align with this problem:\n\n1. **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)**: This contest frequently incorporates advanced geometry problems.\n   \n2. **USA Mathematical Olympiad (USMO)**: Known for its challenging geometry problems, particularly in the USA(J)MO and TST stages for the IMO team.\n\n3. **British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO)**: Similar to the USMO, the BMO includes a variety of advanced geometry problems.\n\n4. **Tournament of the Towns (ToT)**: This problem-solving competition also includes high-level geometry problems, particularly with cyclic properties and excircles.\n\n**Solution Proof**:\n\nWe need to prove that triangle \\( ABC \\) is right-angled given that the circumcentre of triangle \\( A_1B_1C_1 \\), where the excircles opposite vertices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) touch the opposite sides of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) at \\( A_1 \\), \\( B_1 \\), and \\( C_1 \\) respectively, lies on the circumcircle of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. Recall that \\( I_A \\), \\( I_B \\), \\( I_C \\) are the excentres of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and \\( A_1 \\), \\( B_1 \\), and \\( C_1 \\) are their respective touchpoints on \\( BC \\), \\( CA \\), and \\( AB \\).\n\n2. By the properties of excircles and tangency, the quadrilaterals \\( I_A A_1B_1C_1 \\), \\( I_B B_1A_1C_1 \\), and \\( I_C C_1A_1B_1 \\) are cyclic.\n  \n3. The circumcentre of \\( \\triangle A_1B_1C_1 \\) coincides with the circumcenter \\( O \\) of the reference triangle \\( \\triangle I_AIA_1 \\). For simplicity, assume the circumcentre of \\( \\triangle A_1B_1C_1 \\) is \\( O \\).\n\n4. Since \\( O \\) lies on the circumcircle of \\( \\triangle ABC \\), it implies that the circumcentre is the midpoint of the arc opposite to the angle of \\( ABC \\).\n\n5. It must be the case, from cyclic properties and equal angles, that \\( \\angle ACB = 90^\\circ \\) because the circumcentre’s unique constraint implies equal radii configuration and hence perpendicular radius-segmentation.\n\nThus, \\( \\triangle ABC \\) must be right-angled where one angle is exactly \\( 90^\\circ \\).

The tensions and hostilities within the prison could potentially create opportunities for inmates to attempt and succeed in an escape, especially if security measures were somehow compromised.\n\nAnother, though less likely, possibility is that there might have been a clerical or record-keeping error leading to the count discrepancy.

You may ask the guard one question. Two of the doors lead to certain and painful death. One door leads to your escape.

Instead, choose one of the other two doors at random.\n\n2. **Guard's Revelation**: The guard, who always tells the truth and knows which doors lead to death and which leads to escape, will then open one of the remaining doors, revealing it to be a door to certain death.\n\n3. **Switching Doors**: At this point, you have two closed doors in front of you. You know that:\n   - The door you initially chose is not known to lead to death (since the guard opened another for you).\n   - The door that the guard opened (the one leading to death) is not one of the doors you're considering.\n\nTherefore, if you switch to the one remaining closed door, you maximize your chances of finding the door leading to your escape.\n\nThus, the best strategy is to:\n- Choose one door at random.\n- When the guard opens a door leading to death, switch to the remaining closed door.\n\nBy doing this, you maximize your probability of escaping to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), since the guard’s actions will ensure that the only unknown closed door is the one that leads to escape.",

    "question": "In Tolkien’s Silmarillion, what was the argument between Yavanna and Tulkas about, and why was it significant?",
    "answer": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Silmarillion,\" the argument between Yavanna and Tulkas pertains to the fate of the Ents. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Context and Background**: After Melkor (later known as Morgoth) corrupted the Two Trees of Valinor, the light they provided faded from the world. Yavanna, the Vala of Earth and caretaker of the forests and plants, grew despondent over the death of the Trees and the resulting withering of nature.\n\n2. **Creation of the Ents**: To replace the damage wrought by Morgoth, Yavanna created the Ents, beings made from the hardiest parts of certain trees (wood-folk). These beings were intended to protect the forests and plants, continuing the works of Yavanna.\n\n3. **Tulkas’ Anger**: Tulkas, the Vala of strength and physical combat, was furious when he learned about the creation of the Ents. He argued that Yavanna should have left their creation to Manwë and Varda, as the Ents might prove too powerful and destructive in their mighty forms. Tulkas was afraid that giving Yavanna such autonomous power to create life might upset the balance established amongst the Valar, who shared specific domains of influence.\n\n4. **Debate and Outcome**: The quarrel became so heated that it nearly escalated to conflict between Yavanna and Tulkas, even though they were sisters and brothers among the Valar. Ultimately, their dispute was mediated by Manwë, who decided in favor of allowing the Ents to exist, believing that their role in nature was necessary for the world’s balance and protection. However, Yavanna vowed that the Ents would only be roused if Yavanna herself intervened, thereby minimizing their potentially disruptive influence.\n\nThis argument was significant because it highlighted the delicate balance and collaborative governance among the Valar. It also showed Yavanna's dedication to restoring and protecting the natural world, and Tulkas' concern for restraint and order. The compromise preserved the Ents but ensured they would not act unilaterally, underscoring the complexities of divine creation within Tolkien's legendarium.",

You have no other timing device. How can you measure exactly 60 minutes using these two ropes and matches to light them?",
    "answer": "To measure exactly 60 minutes using the two unevenly burning ropes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Light both ends of the first rope** and one end of the second rope simultaneously.\n\n    **After 30 minutes, the first rope will be completely burned out.** While this is happening, the second rope is burning at both ends, and some part of it will still be left. Since the second rope is burning faster at both ends, it will have burned for 60 minutes of single-ended burn time when it is fully lit.\n\n2. **At the 30-minute mark, extinguish the flame at one end of the second rope** and immediately light the other end of the second rope.\n\nWith this approach:\n- The remaining part of the second rope will now burn for another 30 minutes. \n\nTherefore, you have accurately measured 60 minutes from the point you started.\n",

The host opens that door, revealing a goat. The host then asks if you want to switch to Door 2 or 3. What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car?",
    "answer": "To maximize your chances of winning the car, you should switch doors. Here’s the reasoning behind the decision-making process:\n\n1. Initially, you have a 1/3 probability of choosing the door with the car behind it and a 2/3 probability of choosing a goat.\n\n2. After you pick a door and the host reveals a goat behind that door (which is guaranteed since the host will always open a door with a goat), the probabilities change. If you decide to switch, the probability now associated with the remaining door (either Door 2 or 3) is effectively 2/3, because the host has provided additional information.\n\n3. This means that if you originally picked the wrong door, which occurred with a probability of 2/3, switching doors increases your chances of finding the car. The door you didn't pick initially has a higher chance of holding the car, given that the host has influenced the scenario.\n\n4. Conversely, if you chose the car initially, sticking with your original choice would be correct, which happens with a 1/3 probability.\n\nIn conclusion, by switching doors, you leverage the additional information from the host.

    "question": "You have 9 coins, one of which is fake and weighs slightly less than the others. You have a digital scale. How can you find the fake coin?",
    "answer": "To find the fake coin among the 9 coins using a digital scale, we can employ a divide-and-conquer strategy. Here's a step-by-step approach to determine which coin is fake:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Divide the Coins into Three Groups:**\n   Split the 9 coins into three groups of three coins each:\n   - Group 1: Coin 1, Coin 2, Coin 3\n   - Group 2: Coin 4, Coin 5, Coin 6\n   - Group 3: Coin 7, Coin 8, Coin 9\n\n2. **First Weighing:**\n   Place Group 1 on one side of the scale and Group 2 on the other side.\n   - **Case 1:** If the scale balances, then the fake coin is in Group 3. Skip to step 3.\n   - **Case 2:** If the scale tips, the lighter group contains the fake coin. \n\n3. **Second Weighing:**\n   Now we know which group (either Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3) contains the fake coin. Let's assume the scale tipped and the lighter group is Group X (X could be 1 or 2 depending on the result in step 2).\n\n   Take three coins from Group X and weigh two of them against each other:\n   - Weigh Coin X1 against Coin X2.\n   \n     **Sub-case 3.1:** If the scale balances, the fake coin is Coin X3 (the one not weighed).\n     **Sub-case 3.2:** If the scale tips, the lighter coin is the fake one.\n\n4. **Final Weighing (If Necessary):**\n   If you're in Sub-case 3.2, you've already found the fake coin. If you're in Sub-case 3.1, you have identified the fake coin as Coin X3.\n\n### Summary:\n1. Divide into three groups of three coins.\n2. Weigh two of the three groups against each other.\n3. Based on the outcome:\n    - If they balance, the fake coin is in the group not weighed.\n    - If they do not balance, the fake coin is in the lighter group.\n4. Further narrow down by weighing two of the three remaining coins from that group.\n5. Identify the fake coin by the result from the final weighing.\n\nThis strategy allows you to identify the fake coin in just three uses of the digital scale.",

    "answer": "To solve the problem of moving 3 disks from the leftmost stick to the rightmost stick with a middle stick, we need to use a systematic approach, similar to the Tower of Hanoi problem. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Label the sticks**:\n   - Leftmost stick: Stick A\n   - Middle stick: Stick B\n   - Rightmost stick: Stick C\n\n2. **Initial configuration**:\n   - Stick A: Large, Medium, Small\n   - Stick B: Empty\n   - Stick C: Empty\n\n3. **Goal configuration**:\n   - Stick A: Empty\n   - Stick B: Empty\n   - Stick C: Large, Medium, Small\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Move all 3 disks from Stick A to Stick C with the fewest moves.\n\n5. **Steps to achieve the goal**:\n\n   - **Step 1**: Move the smallest disk (Small) from Stick A to Stick C.\n     - **Configuration**: Stick A: Large, Medium; Stick B: Small; Stick C: \n\n   - **Step 2**: Move the medium disk (Medium) from Stick A to Stick B.\n     - **Configuration**: Stick A: Large; Stick B: Small, Medium; Stick C: \n\n   - **Step 3**: Move the largest disk (Large) from Stick A to Stick B.\n     - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: Large, Small, Medium; Stick C: \n\n   - **Step 4**: Move the smallest disk (Small) from Stick B to Stick C.\n     - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: Large, Medium; Stick C: Small\n\n   - **Step 5**: Move the medium disk (Medium) from Stick B to Stick C.\n     - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: Large; Stick C: Small, Medium\n\n   - **Step 6**: Move the largest disk (Large) from Stick B to Stick C.\n     - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: ; Stick C: Large, Medium, Small\n\nHowever, this sequence involves more moves than necessary. A more efficient sequence using the Tower of Hanoi strategy for minimizing moves is as follows:\n\n- **Step 1**: Move the smallest disk from Stick A to Stick C.\n   - **Configuration**: Stick A: Large, Medium; Stick B: Small; Stick C: \n\n- **Step 2**: Move the medium disk from Stick A to Stick B.\n   - **Configuration**: Stick A: Large; Stick B: Small, Medium; Stick C: \n\n- **Step 3**: Move the smallest disk from Stick C to Stick B.\n   - **Configuration**: Stick A: Large; Stick B: Small, Medium, Small; Stick C: \n\n- **Step 4**: Move the largest disk from Stick A to Stick C.\n   - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: Small, Medium, Small; Stick C: Large\n\n- **Step 5**: Move the smallest disk from Stick B to Stick C.\n   - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: Medium, Small; Stick C: Large, Small\n\n- **Step 6**: Move the medium disk from Stick B to Stick C.\n   - **Configuration**: Stick A: ; Stick B: Small; Stick C: Large, Medium, Small\n\nIt appears the most efficient sequence would require **7 moves** rather than 6 as initially outlined. \n\nThus, the minimum number of disk moves required is **7**.\n\n\\boxed{7}",

    "question": "A and B take turns naming increasing numbers. Each player can name as many increasing numbers as they want. The first player starts with 1 and may continue to name numbers until he wants to stop. Then B takes over and so on. The person who says 31 loses. What should A do to start first and win?",
    "answer": "To determine a winning strategy for the first player (A), we need to analyze the game and identify a pattern or a set of moves that will force B into a losing position. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: The game involves two players, A and B, taking turns naming increasing numbers starting from 1. The player who says \"31\" loses, and the goal for the first player (A) is to avoid saying \"31\".\n\n2. **Identifying the Key Strategy**: To avoid saying \"31\", A needs to ensure that if it's B's turn and the number is \"30\", A can say \"31\" next. Therefore, A needs to make sure that after B's turn, the number is always congruent to 0 modulo 4 (i.e., 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28). This is because if B has to say a number congruent to 0 modulo 4, A can then say \"31\" next and win.\n\n3. **Initial Move by A**: A starts the game by saying \"1\". The next turn will be B's, and B can say any number from 2 to 6. To avoid losing, A needs to ensure that after B's turn, the number is congruent to 0 modulo 4. The key is to make sure that after A's first move, the sum of all numbers A and B have said is congruent to 0 modulo 4.\n\n4. **Ensuring the Pattern Continues**: A should start by saying \"1\". Then, B can say any number from 2 to 6. If B says 2, A should say 3 (total so far is 6). If B says 4, A should say 5 (total so far is 10). If B says 6, A should say 7 (total so far is 13). In all these cases, the sum of all numbers said so far is congruent to 2 modulo 4. This means that after B's next turn, the sum will be congruent to 0 modulo 4, and A can continue this strategy.\n\n5. **General Strategy**: A should always say a number such that the total sum of all numbers said so far is congruent to 2 modulo 4 after A's turn. This ensures that B is forced to say a number that will make the total sum congruent to 0 modulo 4 after B's turn, and A can then say \"31\" next and win.\n\nTherefore, the winning strategy for A is to start with \"1\" and ensure that after A's turn, the sum of all numbers said so far is congruent to 2 modulo 4. This will force B to say the number that makes the sum congruent to 0 modulo 4 on the turn before \"31\" is said, and A can then say \"31\" and win.\n\nThe answer is: \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

However, rotating the board may influence aspects of strategy and aesthetics. \n\n### No Change in Rules\nThe key rules of tic-tac-toe remain:\n- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.\n- The player who places three of their symbols in a straight line wins.\n- If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.\n\n### Aesthetic Considerations\nWhile the rules are unchanged, rotating the board may:\n- Provide a fresh visual perspective, which can be interesting for gameplay aesthetics.\n- Potentially create different patterns or sequences that players might subconsciously favor when considering moves. For example, some might find it easier to see a three-in-a-row possibility if the symbols line up a certain way.\n\n### Possible Strategic Adjustments\n1. **Psychological Factors**: The orientation of the board could influence psychological aspects or comfort. For example, some players might feel more comfortable or confident with certain orientations depending on their handedness or personal habits.\n  \n2. **Pattern Recognition**: Rotating the board might affect how quickly players recognize patterns. For instance, diagonal patterns might seem more or less obvious depending on the board's orientation.\n\n### Example\nIf you rotate the board to look like this:\n```\nO   X   X\nX   O     \n   X     \n```\n\nversus this:\n```\nX   O   X\nX     X  \nO        \n```\n\nPlayers might notice different play possibilities or strategies for placing or blocking. Nonetheless, these are minor shifts influenced more by the players' psychology rather than any fundamental change in game strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the fundamental rules and strategies remain the same after a 90-degree rotation, rotating the board might influence player behavior subtly due to changes in perceived patterns and comfort levels. These changes are generally minimal but could impact gameplay dynamics in a casual setting.",

    "question": "Bjorn weighs 85 pounds. Alma weighs 105 pounds. Freja weighs 115 pounds. Two of them standing together on the same scale could weigh 200 pounds, right?",
    "answer": "To determine if two people standing together on a scale could weigh 200 pounds, we need to consider the possible combinations of their weights:\n\n1. Bjorn (85 pounds) + Alma (105 pounds) = 85 + 105 = 190 pounds\n2. Bjorn (85 pounds) + Freja (115 pounds) = 85 + 115 = 200 pounds\n3. Alma (105 pounds) + Freja (115 pounds) = 105 + 115 = 220 pounds\n\nFrom the combinations above, we can see that Bjorn and Freja together weigh 200 pounds. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{Yes}",

    "question": "Which is bigger, 9.9 or 9.11?",
    "answer": "To determine which is bigger between 9.9 and 9.11, we need to compare the two numbers directly.\n\n1. First, look at the whole number parts of both numbers: 9 and 9.\n   Since the whole number parts are the same, we need to compare the decimal parts.\n\n2. Next, compare the decimal parts: 0.9 and 0.11.\n   To do this, we can compare the tenths place and the hundredths place:\n   - The tenths place of 9.9 is 9 (which is 9/10 or 0.9).\n   - The tenths place of 9.11 is 1 (which is 1/10 or 0.1), and the hundredths place is 1 (which is 1/100 or 0.01).\n   Adding these together, 9.11 has a total decimal part of 0.1 + 0.01 = 0.11.\n\n3. Now, compare 0.9 and 0.11:\n   - 0.9 is greater than 0.11.\n\nSince 0.9 is greater than 0.11, 9.9 is greater than 9.11.\n\nTherefore, the bigger number is \\boxed{9.9}.",

    "answer": "The number 3.9 is bigger than 3.14. \n\nTo see why, you can compare the whole number parts first, and then the decimal parts:\n\n- The whole number part of 3.9 is 3.\n- The whole number part of 3.14 is also 3.\n\nNext, compare the decimal parts:\n\n- The decimal part of 3.9 is 0.9.\n- The decimal part of 3.14 is 0.14.\n\nSince 0.9 is greater than 0.14, it follows that 3.9 is greater than 3.14.",

Cities like:\n\n- **Paris, France**: Known for its rich history, iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and charming neighborhoods.\n- **New York City, USA**: Famous for its diverse culture, entertainment, shopping, and iconic views from places like the Empire State Building.\n- **Tokyo, Japan**: A blend of cutting-edge technology and traditional culture, with endless opportunities to explore.\n- **Barcelona, Spain**: Renowned for its unique architecture, cultural festivals, and beautiful beaches.\n- **Istanbul, Turkey**: A city that bridges Europe and Asia, rich in history and culture.\n\nThese cities certainly encourage visitors to wander and explore, much like the verses from the poem!",
