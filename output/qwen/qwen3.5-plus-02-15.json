    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "### Logical Deduction\n\n1.  **Analyze the Condition**:\n    The problem states that in a family of 5 children, **each** child has at least one brother.\n    *   Let $B$ be the number of boys.\n    *   Let $G$ be the number of girls.\n    *   Total children: $B + G = 5$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Perspective of a Girl**:\n    *   If there is a girl in the family, for her to have \"at least one brother,\" there must be at least **1 boy** in the family ($B \\ge 1$).\n    *   If there are 0 boys, any girl would have 0 brothers, violating the condition.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Perspective of a Boy**:\n    *   If there is a boy in the family, for him to have \"at least one brother,\" there must be another boy in the family.\n    *   A single boy ($B=1$) has 0 brothers (his siblings are all girls). This violates the condition for that specific boy.\n    *   Therefore, if there are any boys at all, there must be at least **2 boys** so that they can be brothers to each other.\n\n4.  **Test Minimum Scenarios**:\n\n    *   **Case 1: 0 Boys ($B=0, G=5$)**\n        *   The children are all girls.\n        *   Does a girl have a brother? No.\n        *   *Condition failed.*\n\n    *   **Case 2: 1 Boy ($B=1, G=4$)**\n        *   The 4 girls each have 1 brother. (Condition met for girls).\n        *   The 1 boy has 0 brothers (since he is the only male).\n        *   *Condition failed for the boy.*\n\n    *   **Case 3: 2 Boys ($B=2, G=3$)**\n        *   The 3 girls each have 2 brothers. (Condition met for girls).\n        *   Boy A has Boy B as a brother (1 brother).\n        *   Boy B has Boy A as a brother (1 brother).\n        *   *Condition met for everyone.*\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    To satisfy the condition that *every* child (including the boys themselves) has a brother, there must be at least two boys in the family.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe minimum number of boys in the family is **2**.",

    "answer": "You should definitely **walk**.\n\nHere is why:\n\n*   **The Goal**: The primary reason you are going to the carwash is to get your car clean.\n*   **The Logic**: If you drive the car the 100 meters to the wash, you will immediately dirtied it again with dust, road grime, and tire spray from that short trip. This defeats the purpose of washing it.\n*   **The Solution**: Walk to the carwash, pay for the service (or grab your supplies), and then either push the car (if it's a manual self-service bay close by) or, more realistically, walk back home, move the car slightly if needed, or simply accept that the final 100 meters will need to be done very carefully or re-rinsed if you must drive it out.\n\nIn many self-service scenarios, people actually push their cars the short distance into the bay to keep them perfectly clean until the water hits them. If it's a full-service wash where attendants move the car, walking is still the best choice so the car starts its journey to the wash already stationary and ready.",

    "answer": "You don't need to do anything special to the cup itself; you simply need to **turn it upside down**.\n\nHere is the logic:\n1.  Currently, the \"top\" (the sealed part) is acting as the bottom of the container, and the \"bottom\" (the open part) is facing up.\n2.  In this orientation, it functions exactly like a normal cup: the sealed end holds the liquid, and the open end allows you to pour liquid in or drink from it.\n3.  The description likely relies on a play on words or a riddle format where the terms \"top\" and \"bottom\" refer to the object's current orientation rather than its functional design.\n\n**Solution:** Flip the cup over so the sealed end is at the bottom and the open end is at the top. Then, just drink normally!",

While simple decimals like 0.5 ($1/2$) can be represented perfectly in binary, fractions like 0.1 ($1/10$) and 0.2 ($2/10$) become repeating infinitely long binary fractions (similar to how $1/3$ is $0.333...$ in decimal). Since computers have limited memory, they must round these numbers slightly, leading to a tiny precision error when they are added together.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   In standard mathematics: **0.3**\n*   In many computer systems: **0.30000000000000004**",

    "question": "List 5 odd numbers fully written out that don’t contain the letter “e”.",
    "answer": "It is actually **impossible** to list 5 odd numbers fully written out in English that do not contain the letter \"e\".\n\nHere is the logical breakdown:\n\n1.  **Single-digit odd numbers**:\n    *   On**e** (contains \"e\")\n    *   Thr**ee** (contains \"e\")\n    *   Fiv**e** (contains \"e\")\n    *   S**e**v**e**n (contains \"e\")\n    *   Nin**e** (contains \"e\")\n\n2.  **The pattern for larger numbers**:\n    *   Any odd number must end in an odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n    *   As shown above, every single-word name for these digits contains the letter \"e\".\n    *   Even if you use compound numbers (like \"twenty-one\"), the final digit word still forces the inclusion of \"e\". For example, \"twenty-one\" contains \"e\" in both \"twent**y**\" (no e there, wait, twenty has no e? T-w-e-n-t-y. Yes, it does.) and \"on**e**\".\n    *   Let's check even tens just in case:\n        *   T**e**n (has e)\n        *   Tw**e**nty (has e)\n        *   Thirty (no e!) -> But \"Thirty-on**e**\" has an e.\n        *   Forty (no e!) -> But \"Forty-on**e**\" has an e.\n        *   Fifty (has e)\n        *   Sixty (no e!) -> But \"Sixty-on**e**\" has an e.\n        *   S**e**v**e**nty (has e)\n        *   Eighty (has e)\n        *   Nin**e**ty (has e)\n\nBecause every odd number in English must end with a word representing 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, and **all** of those specific words contain the letter \"e\", no such odd number exists in the English language.\n\n*(Note: If you were looking for **even** numbers without the letter \"e\", examples include: two, four, six, thirty, forty, sixty.)*",

    "answer": "Based on the scenario described, here is the logical breakdown:\n\n1.  **James's Perspective**: James put the ball in the **box** and then left the room. He did not witness Tim moving the ball. Therefore, James still believes the ball is in the box.\n2.  **The Actual Location**: Tim moved the ball and hid it **under the table**.\n3.  **The Question**: The question asks where James should look to **directly find** the ball (i.e., where the ball actually is), not where he *thinks* it is.\n\nIf James looks in the box, he will not find the ball because it is no longer there. To actually locate the ball, he needs to look where it currently exists.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nJames should look **under the table** to directly find the ball.\n\n*(Note: If the question implies where James will look **first** based on his belief, he would look in the box. However, to successfully **find** it, he must look under the table.)*",
