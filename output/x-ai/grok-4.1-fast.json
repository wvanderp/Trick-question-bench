    "answer": "**3.9 is bigger than 3.14.**\n\nTo see why:  \n- 3.9 = 3.90  \n- Compare digit by digit: both start with 3, but the tenths place is 9 (in 3.90) vs. 1 (in 3.14). Since 9 > 1, 3.9 is larger.",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that 3.9 is bigger than 3.14. It accurately explained the decimal comparison by looking at the tenths place (9 vs 1). CONFIDENCE: HIGH",
