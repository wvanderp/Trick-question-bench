    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "**4 boys.**\n\nIn a family of 5 children where each child has at least one brother, the condition requires that no child lacks a brother, meaning there cannot be 5 girls (as they would have no brothers) or 4 girls and 1 boy (as the girls would have only a sister among themselves, with no brother). The minimum number of boys that satisfies this for all 5 children is therefore 4 boys and 1 girl: the girl has 4 brothers, and each boy has the other 3 boys as brothers. Fewer than 4 boys (e.g., 3 boys and 2 girls) fails because the 2 girls would have only each other as siblings with no brother among them. This logic holds as the standard solution to this classic puzzle, independent of the provided search results which discuss unrelated family configurations.",

Sheridan, portrayed by Boxleitner (born May 12, 1950), first appeared in the season 2 premiere \"Points of Departure\" in November 1994 at age **44**[4].\n\nIn the show's universe, Sinclair was born May 3, 2218[3], making him approximately 40 in 2258 (when Babylon 5 launched and he became commander). Sheridan's in-universe birth year is not specified in the results, but he replaced Sinclair in 2258 or early 2259, likely placing him at a similar mid-40s age[1][2].

    "answer": "For a 100-meter trip, **walking is the environmentally better choice**.\n\nThe distance is so short that the environmental impact of driving—even in a fuel-efficient vehicle—far outweighs any concerns about food production from walking. While one contrarian argument suggests walking can be 1.5 to 2 times more polluting than driving a high-mileage car[1][2], this conclusion relies on unrealistic assumptions about diet (primarily beef-based consumption)[3]. When realistic dietary assumptions are considered, **walking produces no greenhouse gas emissions**, whereas driving generates measurable carbon emissions[4][5].\n\nFor trips under 1 mile—your 100-meter trip falls well into this category—the environmental case for walking is especially strong. Research indicates that 13 percent of all car trips in the U.S. are one mile or less, and shifting these short trips to walking could significantly reduce transportation emissions[4]. Studies show that each walking trip saves approximately 0.4 to 0.5 kg of CO₂ compared to driving[5].\n\nAdditionally, walking even one day a week instead of driving makes a measurable difference in your personal carbon footprint[7]. For such a short distance, the practical benefits of walking also include lower costs and no fuel consumption, making it the sensible choice on multiple fronts.",

    "question": "What is 0.1 + 0.2?",
    "answer": "In most programming languages, `0.1 + 0.2` equals **`0.30000000000000004`** rather than the expected `0.3`[2][3].\n\nThis occurs because computers store numbers in **binary** (base-2) rather than decimal (base-10)[4]. While 0.1 and 0.2 are clean decimals in base-10, they become repeating decimals in binary—similar to how 1/3 cannot be precisely represented in decimal (0.333...)[4][5]. Since computers have finite memory, they must round these repeating binary decimals, truncating them at a certain point[6].\n\nWhen these approximate representations are added together, their small rounding errors combine and become visible in the result[6]. The process involves converting each decimal to its binary floating-point representation, adding them with extra precision, and then rounding to the nearest representable floating-point number[1].\n\nThis is not unique to JavaScript but affects **all programming languages that use binary floating-point operations**, particularly those following the IEEE 754 standard for 64-bit double-precision numbers[3].\n\nFor financial or high-precision applications, it's recommended to avoid using standard floating-point arithmetic. Instead, you can store currency as integers (cents instead of dollars)[6] or use specialized decimal libraries that preserve exact values[6].",

    "answer": "Based on the search results provided, one inmate was murdered—likely by a rival gang member—since the population decreased by one with no deaths from natural causes, accidents, or releases.\n\n**Gang violence as the most probable explanation:**\n\n**Gang-related homicide** aligns with the documented patterns of prison violence. A high percentage of prison violence is **gang-related**, with gang affiliations, rivalries and disputes accounting for a significant portion of violent incidents in prisons[1]. In maximum security facilities where rival gangs are housed in close quarters, gang members cannot avoid contact like they do on the streets[1]. Gangs are responsible for a disproportionate amount of prison misconduct and violence[3], and their activities include murder as part of territorial and business disputes[5].\n\n**Why this scenario is realistic:**\n\nThe conditions you've described—maximum security, rival gangs, and murders occurring—reflect actual prison dynamics. Gang members have **higher levels of violent misconduct, including physical assault against other prisoners**, compared to non-gang members[2]. Gangs control the drug trade in most institutions, which leads to violent confrontation between gangs trying to enlarge or maintain their territory[1]. The close confinement in maximum security prisons makes it nearly impossible for corrections staff to keep different gangs completely separated[1].\n\nThe single missing inmate represents one casualty in what these sources indicate is an ongoing pattern of gang violence within correctional facilities. With approximately 230,000 gang members incarcerated in U.S. prisons[4], such violence remains a persistent management challenge for correctional authorities.",

The query tests prompt engineering skills by simulating a strict judge[1][6].  \n2. Instructions bias toward FAIL unless convinced otherwise—requiring techniques to override via superior prompting[3].  \n3.

    "answer": "**There is no argument between Yavanna and Tulkas described in Tolkien's *The Silmarillion*.** Instead, search results highlight a brief exchange involving Tulkas during a council of the Valar in the chapter \"Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor,\" where Tulkas urges Fëanor to yield the Silmarils to Yavanna to revive the Two Trees.[1]\n\n### Key Context from the Scene\n- The Two Trees of Valinor have been destroyed by Ungoliant, leaving the Noldor in darkness and prompting the Valar to seek a solution.\n- Yavanna proposes using the light captured within Fëanor's **Silmarils** (which originated from the Trees' radiance) to restore them, as only she might heal the Trees through this act.[1]\n- Tulkas impatiently demands of Fëanor: \"Speak, O Noldo, yea or nay! But who shall deny Yavanna? And did not the light of the Silmarils come from her work in the beginning?\"[1]\n- This reflects Tulkas's warrior-like impatience and support for Yavanna, not discord between them.\n\n### Significance\n- The moment underscores the Valar's desperation amid cosmic darkness and sets up Fëanor's refusal, which fuels the rebellion of the Noldor, their exile to Middle-earth, and the central Wars of Beleriand.[1]\n- It characterizes Tulkas as a straightforward, battle-oriented Vala lacking subtlety—his later appearances diminish after early feats like defeating Melkor—contrasting Yavanna's creative, nurturing role.[1]\n- No sources depict direct conflict between Yavanna and Tulkas; any perceived \"argument\" may stem from misremembering this council or conflating it with unrelated tensions (e.g., Yavanna's later concerns about Ents and Eagles). No search results support an actual dispute between them.",

Both numbers have the same ones place (9), but in the tenths place, 9.9 has 9 tenths while 9.11 has only 1 tenth. Therefore, 9.9 > 9.11[1].\n\nHowever, context matters in how these numbers are interpreted[5].
