It gets rounded to the nearest 52-bit significand with exponent -4: \\(2^{-4} + \\frac{2702159776422298}{2^{56}} \\approx 0.1\\). [1][2]\n- **0.2** is \\(0.001100110011\\ldots_2\\), rounded similarly with exponent -3 and the same significand. [1][2]\n- Adding these approximations: The exact sum is \\(3000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875 / 2^{55}\\), which rounds to \\(0.3000000000000000444089209850062616169452667236328125\\) (displayed as `0.30000000000000004`) due to even significand rounding rules. [1]\n\n### Verification in Code\nIn Python or JavaScript:\n```\n>>> 0.1 + 0.2\n0.30000000000000004\n```\nYet `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` often returns `true` due to built-in tolerance (e.g., epsilon ~\\(2.22 \\times 10^{-16}\\)). [1][4][5]\n\n### Practical Fixes\n- Use tolerance checks: `Math.abs(a - b) < Number.EPSILON`. [5]\n- For precision (e.g., finance), use integers (store cents) or libraries like `decimal.Decimal` in Python. [5]\n\nThis behavior is standard across languages following IEEE 754, not a bug.

While search results highlight prison violence from rival gangs[1][2][3], overcrowding[1], and turnover[1], these do not fit the \"no one died... no prisoners were released\" constraints, as gang murders would count as deaths.\n\nInstead, the logical explanation is a **birth**: one inmate's child was born in the prison (possible in mixed-gender facilities or via contraband), temporarily making 101 people present. Then, without violating rules, the prison reached 99 inmates via:\n- A **new male inmate admitted** (common turnover[1]), but one transferred out.\n- Or the baby (if male) counted, with an inmate transferred.\n\nThis preserves the inmate count as \"male inmates\" start/end while explaining the drop without prohibited causes.

Their unity on this point reinforces the Valar's collective resolve against Melkor's chaos, setting the stage for later conflicts like the assault on Utumno.[1] No sources depict discord between them; Tulkas later echoes Yavanna's priorities indirectly when pressing Fëanor about the Silmarils' light to revive the Two Trees.[1]",

    "answer": "**9.9 is bigger than 9.11.**\n\nTo compare these decimal numbers mathematically, align them by place value: 9.9 equals 9.90, so the tenths place is 9 (for 9.9) versus 1 (for 9.11). Since 9 > 1 in the tenths place, 9.9 > 9.11.[5]\n\nEquivalently, 9.9 = 9 + 0.9 = 9.9, while 9.11 = 9 + 0.1 + 0.01 = 9.11, confirming 9.9 is larger by 0.79.\n\nMany sources, including AI responses discussed online, incorrectly claim 9.11 is larger due to flawed digit-by-digit comparison (misreading tenths as 1 vs. 9) or confusing numerical value with versioning/chapter ordering (e.g., 9.11 follows 9.9 in Bibles or Dewey Decimal).[1][2][3][4][5][6] In pure math, however, 9.9 is unambiguously greater.[5]",
