The bat costs \\( b + 2 \\), and their total is 3.30.\n\nSet up the equation:  \n\\[ b + (b + 2) = 3.30 \\]  \n\\[ 2b + 2 = 3.30 \\]  \n\\[ 2b = 1.30 \\]  \n\\[ b = 0.65 \\] Wait, no—that's incorrect; many intuitively guess around there, but it fails the conditions.\n\nThe intuitive error assumes the ball is $1.30 (3.30 - 2), making the bat $3.30, totaling $4.60. Instead, solve correctly: ball is $0.30, bat is $2.30 ($0.30 + $2.00), totaling $2.60? No—for $3.30 total and $2 difference.\n\nStandard method from the puzzle (scaled): ball \\( x \\), bat \\( x + 2 \\), \\( 2x + 2 = 3.30 \\), \\( 2x = 1.30 \\), \\( x = 0.65 \\)? Let's check: 0.65 + 2.65 = 3.30, and 2.65 - 0.65 = 2. Yes!\n\n**Correct: ball $0.65, bat $2.65.** [1][2]\n\n## Why Intuitive Answer Fails\nPeople often think ball is $1.30 (3.30 minus the $2 difference), bat $3.30, but total becomes $4.60.

    "question": "In Tolkien’s Silmarillion, what was the argument between Yavanna and Tulkas about, and why was it significant?",
    "answer": "**In J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Silmarillion*, Yavanna and Tulkas did not have a direct argument between themselves.** Instead, they aligned during a Valar council in the chapter \"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor,\" where both urged action against Melkor (Morgoth). Yavanna expressed grief over Melkor's corruption of Middle-earth's trees and plants, warning that the Elves—Ilúvatar's Children—might awaken to darkness and evil, mistaking Melkor for their lord.[1][2][3]\n\n## Context\nYavanna, the Vala of growth and nature (also called Kementári), feared Melkor's spreading shadow from his fortress Angband, which blighted her creations.[1] Tulkas, the warrior Vala known for strength and impatience, immediately supported her by calling for swift war: \"Nay! Let us make war swiftly! Have we not rested from strife overlong?\"[1]\n\n## Significance\nTheir shared push overcame the Valar's hesitation, as Mandos noted the Elves' fated awakening under Varda's stars alone, prompting her to kindle brighter constellations like Valacirca (the Sickle of the Valar).[2] This led to the War for the Sake of the Elves: the Valar assaulted Utumno, Tulkas wrestled and chained Melkor with Angainor (forged by Aulë), and Middle-earth's shape was forever altered—though Melkor's servants like Sauron endured.[1][2] The event protected the newly awakened Quendi (Elves) at Cuiviénen from corruption, enabling Oromë's summons to Valinor and shaping the First Age's core conflicts.[3]",
