    "answer": "If each child in the family of 5 children has at least one brother, this means that there cannot be a situation where all children are girls, because then none of the girls would have a brother. Therefore, there must be at least one boy.\n\nHowever, if there is only one boy, the other four children would be girls, and the boy would have no brothers, which contradicts the condition that each child has at least one brother. Therefore, there must be more than one boy.\n\nThe minimum number of boys that satisfies the condition that each child has at least one brother is two. With two boys, each child in the family has at least one brother, and the condition is met.",

    "answer": "Let's denote the cost of the ball as \\( B \\) and the cost of the bat as \\( B + 2 \\) (since the bat costs $2 more than the ball).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total cost of the bat and the ball is $3.30. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ B + (B + 2) = 3.30 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 2B + 2 = 3.30 \\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate the terms with \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ 2B = 3.30 - 2 \\]\n\\[ 2B = 1.30 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{1.30}{2} \\]\n\\[ B = 0.65 \\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.65.\n\nTo find the cost of the bat, we add $2 to the cost of the ball:\n\n\\[ B + 2 = 0.65 + 2 \\]\n\\[ B + 2 = 2.65 \\]\n\nTherefore, the bat costs $2.65.\n\nIn summary:\n- The ball costs $0.65.\n- The bat costs $2.65.",

When one of its heads is cut off, two more grow in its place. This makes it a formidable opponent, as it seems impossible to defeat by beheading.\n\n2. **Cockatrice**: In European folklore, the Cockatrice is a two-legged bird with the head and sometimes the tail of a rooster, and the body of a dragon or serpent. According to some legends, if a cockatrice looks at a person directly, the person will turn to stone. However, the specific detail about another animal appearing when it is beheaded is not a common trait attributed to the Cockatrice in traditional folklore.\n\nGiven the context of your question, the Hydra is the more fitting example.",

    "answer": "If the top of the cup is sealed and the bottom is open, it's not designed for drinking in the traditional way. However, you can still use it creatively. Here are a couple of suggestions:\n\n1. **Pour Over**: Pour a beverage into the cup and then pour it out into another container or directly into your mouth. This method is similar to how you might use a funnel.\n\n2. **Straw**: If the seal on the top is thin enough, you might be able to poke a small hole through it and insert a straw. This would allow you to drink from the cup in a more conventional way.\n\n3. **Use as a Decanter**: If the cup is large enough, you can use it as a decorative piece or a decanter to pour drinks into other glasses.\n\n4. **DIY Modification**: If you're handy with tools, you could carefully cut or drill a hole in the top to create an opening for drinking. Be cautious with this approach to avoid damaging the cup or injuring yourself.\n\nAlways ensure that any modifications you make are safe and won't compromise the structural integrity of the cup.",

The Gothic alphabet was used to write the Gothic language, an extinct East Germanic language that was spoken by the Goths. The Gothic alphabet is based on the Greek alphabet with the addition of a few letters derived from the Old Italic and Runic alphabets.\n\nIn the Gothic language, 𐍈 (wulþus) represents the sound /w/ or /ʍ/, similar to the \"w\" in English.

    "answer": "Given the scenario where there are 100 male inmates at the beginning of the year and 99 at the end of the year, with no deaths from natural causes or accidents and no prisoners being released, the most plausible explanation is that one inmate was killed by another inmate. Here are a few possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Inmate-on-Inmate Violence**: One inmate was murdered by another inmate. This could be due to gang rivalries, personal disputes, or other forms of violence that are unfortunately common in high-security prisons.\n\n2. **Prisoner Transfer**: While it was stated that no prisoners were released, it is possible that one inmate was transferred to another facility. This could be due to disciplinary actions, security concerns, or other administrative reasons.\n\n3. **Legal or Administrative Action**: There might have been a legal or administrative action that resulted in one inmate being moved to a different facility or status, such as being placed in solitary confinement or transferred to a psychiatric unit within the prison.\n\n4. **Misreporting**: There could be a clerical error or misreporting where the actual number of inmates was not accurately recorded at the end of the year.\n\nGiven the context of rival gangs and frequent violence, the most likely scenario is that one inmate was killed by another, leading to the reduction in the inmate population from 100 to 99.",

    "question": "In Tolkien’s Silmarillion, what was the argument between Yavanna and Tulkas about, and why was it significant?",
    "answer": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Silmarillion,\" there is a notable argument between Yavanna Kementári, the Valier of the Earth and the plants and animals, and Tulkas, the Valar of strength and valor. This argument occurs during the Music of the Ainur, the great symphony that shaped the creation of the world.\n\nThe argument revolves around the nature of the creatures that would inhabit Arda (the Earth). Yavanna desired the creation of beings that would tend to the earth and the plants, ensuring that the world would be nurtured and cared for. She envisioned creatures that would be in harmony with the natural world. On the other hand, Tulkas, who was more concerned with strength and valor, wanted beings that would be strong and capable of defending themselves and the world against potential threats.\n\nThis argument is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Balance of Nature and Strength**: It highlights the need for balance in the world, where both the nurturing aspects of nature and the protective strength of its inhabitants are essential.\n\n2. **Creation of Ents**: The argument is directly related to the creation of the Ents, the ancient tree-like beings who were designed to care for the forests and the natural world. Yavanna's desire for such beings was eventually fulfilled, and the Ents played a crucial role in the history of Middle-earth.\n\n3. **Thematic Depth**: It adds depth to the themes of creation, purpose, and the interconnectedness of all living things in Tolkien's mythology. The argument underscores the idea that every aspect of creation has a role to play and that harmony between different elements is necessary for the world to thrive.\n\n4. **Character Development**: It provides insight into the personalities and priorities of the Valar, showing that even the most powerful beings have differing views and must work together to achieve a balanced creation.\n\nOverall, this argument between Yavanna and Tulkas is a foundational element in the mythology of Middle-earth, illustrating the complex interplay between different aspects of creation and the importance of balance in the natural world.",
