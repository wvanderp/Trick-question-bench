    "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of boys in the family given that each child has at least one brother.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The family has 5 children.\n- Each child has at least one brother.\n\nTo find the minimum number of boys, we can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: All 5 children are boys.\nIn this case, the minimum number of boys in the family is 5.\n\nCase 2: There are 4 boys and 1 girl.\nEach child has at least one brother, so the girl must have a brother. This means there are at least 4 boys in the family.\n\nCase 3: There are 3 boys and 2 girls.\nEach child has at least one brother, so each of the 2 girls must have a brother. This means there are at least 3 boys in the family.\n\nCase 4: There are 2 boys and 3 girls.\nEach child has at least one brother, so each of the 3 girls must have a brother.

Distance - The carwash is only 100 meters away, which is a very short distance. Walking this short distance is more efficient and environmentally friendly than starting your car and driving.\n\n2. Convenience - Walking 100 meters is quick and easy, whereas getting in your car, driving the short distance, and finding parking at the carwash may be more of a hassle.\n\n3. Environmental impact - Driving such a short distance uses more fuel and produces more emissions per mile compared to walking. Choosing to walk is the more eco-friendly option.\n\n4. Health benefits - Walking 100 meters is a small but meaningful amount of physical activity that can provide health benefits, especially if you do this regularly.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason that makes walking impractical (such as mobility issues or carrying heavy items), walking the 100 meters to the carwash is the better choice in this scenario. It's more efficient, convenient, and environmentally responsible.",

This may take some getting used to, but it could work.\n\n2. Poke a hole in the top: Carefully use a sharp object to puncture a small hole in the sealed top of the cup. This will allow you to drink from the cup in a more conventional way.\n\n3. Use a straw: Insert a straw through the sealed top and use it to drink the contents of the cup.\n\n4. Ask your friend: They may be able to provide more details on the intended use of this unusual cup. There could be a specific way it's meant to be used that isn't immediately obvious.\n\nThe key is to think creatively and experiment safely to find a way to drink from this unconventionally designed cup.

Ze zijn gemaakt van materialen die niet geschikt zijn om te eten.",
