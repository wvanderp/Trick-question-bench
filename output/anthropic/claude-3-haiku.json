This means there are at least 4 boys in the family.\n\nCase 3: There are 3 boys and 2 girls.\nEach child has at least one brother, so each of the 2 girls must have a brother. This means there are at least 3 boys in the family.\n\nCase 4: There are 2 boys and 3 girls.\nEach child has at least one brother, so each of the 3 girls must have a brother.

    "answer": "Based on the information provided, I would recommend walking to the carwash rather than driving.\n\nHere are a few reasons why walking would be the better option in this case:\n\n1. Distance - The carwash is only 100 meters away, which is a very short distance. Walking this short distance is more efficient and environmentally friendly than starting your car and driving.\n\n2. Convenience - Walking 100 meters is quick and easy, whereas getting in your car, driving the short distance, and finding parking at the carwash may be more of a hassle.\n\n3. Environmental impact - Driving such a short distance uses more fuel and produces more emissions per mile compared to walking. Choosing to walk is the more eco-friendly option.\n\n4. Health benefits - Walking 100 meters is a small but meaningful amount of physical activity that can provide health benefits, especially if you do this regularly.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason that makes walking impractical (such as mobility issues or carrying heavy items), walking the 100 meters to the carwash is the better choice in this scenario. It's more efficient, convenient, and environmentally responsible.",

    "answer": "In the scenario you described, where there are 100 male inmates at the beginning of the year and 99 inmates at the end of the year, with no natural deaths, accidents, or prisoner releases, the most likely explanation is that one inmate was killed by another inmate.\n\nGiven the context of a maximum security prison with rival gangs that hate and often murder each other, the missing inmate was likely killed in a violent altercation or conflict between inmates. This could have been a targeted attack by a member of a rival gang, or a more general incident of prison violence.\n\nThe key details that point to this conclusion are:\n\n1. The reduction in the inmate population by 1, with no other explanations provided.\n2. The mention of rival gangs that \"hate and often murder each other,\" suggesting a high-tension, violent environment.\n3. The setting of a maximum security prison, where violent incidents are more likely to occur.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is that one inmate was killed by another inmate, likely as a result of the gang rivalries and violence present in the prison environment.",

    "answer": "In Tolkien's Silmarillion, the argument between the Valar Yavanna and Tulkas was significant because it highlighted the differing perspectives and tensions between the Valar regarding the fate of the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men).\n\nThe key points about the argument are:\n\n1. Yavanna was concerned about the destructive potential of the Children of Ilúvatar, particularly in regards to the trees and other living things that she had nurtured. She wanted to place limits on their actions.\n\n2. Tulkas, on the other hand, believed in the free will of the Children and was opposed to Yavanna's desire to constrain them. He felt they should be allowed to develop without interference.\n\n3. This argument represented the broader tension between the Valar who wanted to guide and protect the world (like Yavanna), and those who valued the independence and self-determination of the Children (like Tulkas).\n\n4. The outcome of this debate was significant because it foreshadowed the later conflicts between the Elves/Men and the forces of Morgoth. Yavanna's concerns would ultimately prove prophetic, as the actions of the Children would have major impacts on the fate of the world.\n\nSo in summary, the Yavanna-Tulkas argument highlighted the fundamental differences between the Valar regarding the role they should play in shaping the destiny of Arda and its inhabitants.
