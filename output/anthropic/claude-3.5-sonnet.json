    "answer": "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * There are 5 children in total\n   * Each child has at least one brother\n   * We need to find the minimum number of boys\n\n2) Let's consider what it means for each child to have at least one brother:\n   * If someone is a boy, he needs at least one other boy as a brother\n   * If someone is a girl, she needs at least one boy as a brother\n\n3) Let's try different numbers of boys:\n   * If there are 1 boy:\n     * The one boy would have no brothers\n     * This doesn't work because every child needs at least one brother\n\n   * If there are 2 boys:\n     * Each boy would have 1 brother\n     * Each girl (3 girls) would have 2 brothers\n     * This works because everyone has at least one brother\n\n   * If there are 3 or more boys:\n     * This would also satisfy the condition\n\n4) Therefore, 2 boys is the minimum number that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe answer is 2.\n\nTo verify this is minimal:\n* We can't have fewer than 2 boys because then no one would have a brother\n* 2 boys works because everyone (both the boys and the girls) has at least one brother",

    "answer": "9.9 is bigger than 9.11 because in decimal numbers, the digits after the decimal point represent tenths, hundredths, etc. So:\n\n9.9 = 9.90 (when written with the same number of decimal places)\n9.11\n\nTherefore, 9.9 (or 9.90) is greater than 9.11 by 0.79.",
