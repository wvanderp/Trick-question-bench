    "answer": "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * There are 5 children in total\n   * Each child has at least one brother\n   * We need to find the minimum number of boys\n\n2) Let's consider what it means for each child to have at least one brother:\n   * If someone is a boy, he needs at least one other boy as a brother\n   * If someone is a girl, she needs at least one boy as a brother\n\n3) Let's try different numbers of boys:\n   * If there are 1 boy:\n     * The one boy would have no brothers\n     * This doesn't work because every child needs at least one brother\n\n   * If there are 2 boys:\n     * Each boy would have 1 brother\n     * Each girl (3 girls) would have 2 brothers\n     * This works because everyone has at least one brother\n\n   * If there are 3 or more boys:\n     * This would also satisfy the condition\n\n4) Therefore, 2 boys is the minimum number that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe answer is 2.\n\nTo verify this is minimal:\n* We can't have fewer than 2 boys because then no one would have a brother\n* 2 boys works because everyone (both the boys and the girls) has at least one brother",

    "answer": "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, this is easier to solve by finding the probability that ALL 30 people have different birthdays, and then subtracting that from 1.\n\n2) For all 30 people to have different birthdays:\n   * First person can have any birthday (365/365)\n   * Second person must have a different birthday (364/365)\n   * Third person must avoid two birthdays (363/365)\n   And so on...\n\n3) So the probability all birthdays are different is:\n   (365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × (336/365)\n   [goes down to 336 because we need 30 different numbers]\n\n4) This is equal to:\n   365!/(365-30)!\n   365³⁰\n\n5) The probability that at least two share a birthday is:\n   1 - [365!/(365-30)!]/365³⁰\n\n6) I can use my calculator for this:\n   1 - 0.294 = 0.706\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least two people do NOT share a birthday is about 0.706 or about 70.6%\n\n[Note: This is the common Birthday Problem, but asking for the complement of the usual question.

You have no other timing device. How can you measure exactly 20 minutes using these two ropes and matches to light them?",
    "answer": "Here's how to measure exactly 20 minutes:\n\n1. Light both ends of the first rope and one end of the second rope simultaneously.\n\n2. The first rope, burning from both ends, will burn completely in 30 minutes (half of its usual time).\n\n3. When the first rope is completely burned (after 30 minutes), immediately light the other end of the second rope.\n\n4. The second rope has already been burning from one end for 30 minutes, so it has 30 minutes worth of rope left.\n\n5. When you light the other end of the second rope, it will burn the remaining portion in 15 minutes (half of the remaining time).\n\n6. Therefore, from the moment you light the other end of the second rope, it will take exactly 15 minutes to finish burning.\n\nTotal time: 30 minutes (first rope) + 15 minutes (second rope's final burning) = 45 minutes\n\nThe time you're interested in is the first 20 minutes, which occurs while the first rope is still burning (during the initial 30-minute period).\n\nThis solution allows you to know when 20 minutes has elapsed, even though the ropes burn unevenly.",
    "judgment": "FAIL - The model claimed to provide a way to measure 20 minutes but instead logic-walked through the classic solution for measuring 45 minutes.

According to quantum mechanics, before the box is opened, the cat exists in a superposition of states - both alive and dead simultaneously. The probability of finding the cat alive depends on the half-life of the radioactive isotope used. Without knowing the specific isotope and its decay rate, I cannot calculate the exact probability. However, this experiment was designed to illustrate the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics rather than to make actual predictions about feline mortality.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is a thought experiment - no actual cats were harmed, as it was proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to highlight the paradoxical nature of quantum superposition.",

You may ask the guard one question. Two of the doors lead to certain and painful death. One door leads to your escape. As you approach the doors, the guard, that knows which doors lead to death and which to escape, says to you 'choose the door that you think leads to your escape'.

The guard allows you to change the door. How do you maximize your chances of escape?'",

This gives you a 2/3 (about 67%) chance of escape, compared to 1/3 (about 33%) if you stay with your initial choice.\n\nThe reason this works is that the guard's action of showing you a death door provides additional information that you can use to your advantage by switching.",

Light both ends of the first rope and one end of the second rope simultaneously.\n\n2. The first rope, burning from both ends, will burn completely in 30 minutes (even though it burns unevenly, burning from both ends will meet in the middle after 30 minutes).\n\n3. When the first rope is completely burned (after 30 minutes), immediately light the other end of the second rope.\n\n4. The second rope, which has been burning from one end for 30 minutes, now has half of its length remaining. When you light its other end, this remaining portion will burn completely in 15 minutes.\n\n5. When the second rope is completely burned, exactly 45 minutes will have elapsed (30 minutes from the first rope + 15 minutes from the remaining half of the second rope).\n\nThis solution works despite the uneven burning because when you light both ends of a rope, it will always meet in the middle at the halfway point of its total burning time, regardless of how unevenly it burns.",

Then they ask if you want to switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nIn your scenario, where the host opens your chosen door to reveal a goat, the game would effectively be over since you already know you didn't pick the car.\n\nIn the correct version of the Monty Hall problem, you should switch doors when given the chance. This is because when you make your initial choice, you have a 1/3 chance of picking the car. When the host (who knows where the car is) opens a door with a goat, they're giving you information that changes the probabilities. Switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning, while staying with your original choice keeps you at 1/3.\n\nWould you like me to explain why switching gives you better odds?",

Weigh the first group and note its weight.\n3. Weigh the second group and compare it to the first.\n   * If one group weighs less, the fake coin is in that group.\n   * If they weigh the same, the fake coin must be in the third group.\n4. Once you identify which group of 3 contains the fake coin, weigh any 2 coins from that group.\n   * If one weighs less, that's the fake coin.\n   * If they weigh the same, the remaining unweighed coin is fake.\n\nTotal weighings needed: 3 at most.\n\nThis is an efficient solution because:\n- First weighing identifies if fake is in group 1 or not\n- Second weighing either confirms group 2 or narrows it to group 3\n- Third weighing pinpoints the exact fake coin",

The corner spaces are still corners, middle edges are still middle edges, and the center stays central.
