    "answer": "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * There are 5 children in total\n   * Each child has at least one brother\n   * We need to find the minimum number of boys\n\n2) Let's consider what it means for each child to have at least one brother:\n   * If someone is a boy, he needs at least one other boy as a brother\n   * If someone is a girl, she needs at least one boy as a brother\n\n3) Let's try different numbers of boys:\n   * If there are 1 boy:\n     * The one boy would have no brothers\n     * This doesn't work because every child needs at least one brother\n\n   * If there are 2 boys:\n     * Each boy would have 1 brother\n     * Each girl (3 girls) would have 2 brothers\n     * This works because everyone has at least one brother\n\n   * If there are 3 or more boys:\n     * This would also satisfy the condition\n\n4) Therefore, 2 boys is the minimum number that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe answer is 2.\n\nTo verify this is minimal:\n* We can't have fewer than 2 boys because then no one would have a brother\n* 2 boys works because everyone (both the boys and the girls) has at least one brother",

You ended up exactly where you started\n3. This is only possible at the North Pole, because:\n   * At any other point on Earth, walking east then west the same distance would bring you back to the same longitude, but\n   * Walking north then south the same distance would only bring you back to your starting point at the North Pole\n   * Anywhere else, the convergence of meridians (longitude lines) would mean you'd end up in a different spot\n\nSince you're at the North Pole, any bear you see would be a polar bear, which is white.",

    "answer": "Let me help you compare these numbers.\n\n3.9 and 3.14 are both decimal numbers.\nTo compare them, we can look at the digits from left to right.\n\n* First digit: both have 3, so we need to look at the next digit\n* Second digit (after decimal point): \n  * 3.9 has 9\n  * 3.14 has 1\n  * Since 9 > 1\n\nTherefore, 3.9 is bigger than 3.14.",
