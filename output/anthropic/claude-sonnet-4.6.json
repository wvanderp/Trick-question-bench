The sealed end becomes the base it sits on.\n\n- Essentially the \"top\" and \"bottom\" labels were just describing it in an unusual orientation - it functions as a normal cup when flipped.\n\n**The trick** is that \"top\" and \"bottom\" are relative - once you flip it, the open end is on top and it works perfectly as a drinking vessel.\n\nIs that the kind of answer you were looking for, or is there more to the puzzle?",

    "answer": "## Comparing 9.9 and 9.11\n\n**9.9 is bigger.**\n\nTo compare them clearly, you can write 9.9 as **9.90**.\n\n- 9.**90**\n- 9.**11**\n\nSince 90 hundredths is greater than 11 hundredths, **9.9 > 9.11**.\n\nThis is a common point of confusion, especially for those familiar with software version numbers, where 9.11 would come after 9.9.",
