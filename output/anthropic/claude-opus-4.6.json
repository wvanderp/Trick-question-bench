    "answer": "# Finding the Minimum Number of Boys\n\n## Setting Up the Problem\n\nI need to find the minimum number of boys in a family of 5 children, given that **each child has at least one brother**.\n\n## Analyzing the Condition\n\n\"Each child has at least one brother\" means every child in the family must have at least one male sibling.\n\nLet me consider what this requires for each type of child:\n\n- **For each boy**: He needs at least one brother → there must be at least one *other* boy in the family. So there must be at least **2 boys**.\n\n- **For each girl**: She needs at least one brother → there must be at least **1 boy** in the family.\n\n## Testing the Minimum\n\n**Can we have just 1 boy?** \n- The 4 girls would each have a brother ✓\n- But the 1 boy would have **no brothers** ✗\n\n**Can we have 2 boys?**\n- Each girl has at least one brother ✓\n- Each boy has the other boy as a brother ✓\n\nThis works! With 2 boys and 3 girls, every child has at least one brother.\n\n## Answer\n\nThe minimum number of boys is $\\boxed{2}$.",

The Gothic alphabet drew from **Greek**, **Latin**, and possibly **Runic** sources. Hwair doesn't have a clear Greek model, so it may derive from Latin or runic influence.\n\n## Significance:\n\nThis sound (the voiceless labio-velar approximant) was inherited from Proto-Germanic *\\*hw* and is a distinctively archaic feature.

    "answer": "I'm not familiar with the word \"zombatzimbelwipper.\" It doesn't appear to be a recognized word in any language I know of. It may be a made-up or nonsense word, a very obscure regional/dialect term, or perhaps something from a specific fictional work.\n\nCould you share where you encountered it? That might help me provide more context.",
