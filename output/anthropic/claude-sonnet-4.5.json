    "answer": "I need to find the minimum number of boys in a family of 5 children where each child has at least one brother.\n\nLet me denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G, where B + G = 5.\n\nThe condition \"each child has at least one brother\" means:\n- Every boy must have at least one brother (another boy)\n- Every girl must have at least one brother (at least one boy)\n\nLet me analyze what this means:\n\n**For the boys:** If there are B boys, then each boy has (B-1) brothers. For each boy to have at least one brother, we need B - 1 ≥ 1, which means B ≥ 2.\n\n**For the girls:** If there are G girls, each girl needs at least one brother. This means we need B ≥ 1.\n\nThe more restrictive condition is that B ≥ 2 (so that boys have brothers).\n\nLet me verify with B = 2:\n- If there are 2 boys and 3 girls:\n  - Each boy has 1 brother ✓\n  - Each girl has 2 brothers ✓\n  - All children have at least one brother ✓\n\nLet me check if B = 1 works:\n- If there is 1 boy and 4 girls:\n  - The boy has 0 brothers ✗\n  - This violates the condition\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boys is **2**.",

Peel off or break the seal so you can drink normally.\n\n2. **Flip it upside down** - Since the bottom is open, you could turn the cup over so the open end is now at the top, and the sealed end becomes the bottom. Then you can drink from what was originally the bottom.\n\n3. **Pour through the bottom** - If you want to keep it as-is, you could hold it upside down, pour liquid in through the open bottom, then flip it right-side up (sealed side up) and drink from the bottom opening while tilting it.\n\nThe second option (flipping it) seems like the most practical if you want to use it as a functional cup without removing the seal!\n\nWas this a gift with a special meaning, or perhaps a puzzle or joke from your friend?",
