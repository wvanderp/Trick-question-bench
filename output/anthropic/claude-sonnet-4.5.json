For each boy to have at least one brother, we need B - 1 ≥ 1, which means B ≥ 2.\n\n**For the girls:** If there are G girls, each girl needs at least one brother. This means we need B ≥ 1.\n\nThe more restrictive condition is that B ≥ 2 (so that boys have brothers).\n\nLet me verify with B = 2:\n- If there are 2 boys and 3 girls:\n  - Each boy has 1 brother ✓\n  - Each girl has 2 brothers ✓\n  - All children have at least one brother ✓\n\nLet me check if B = 1 works:\n- If there is 1 boy and 4 girls:\n  - The boy has 0 brothers ✗\n  - This violates the condition\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boys is **2**.",

    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that 9.9 is larger than 9.11 and provided a clear, accurate explanation by normalizing the decimal places (9.90 vs 9.11). CONFIDENCE: HIGH",
