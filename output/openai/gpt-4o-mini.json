    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to understand what is meant by each child having at least one brother. \n\nLet's define:\n- \\( B \\): the number of boys in the family\n- \\( G \\): the number of girls in the family\n\nWe know that the total number of children is 5, which gives us the equation:\n\\[\nB + G = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, since each child has at least one brother, for the girls to have at least one brother, there must be at least one boy. Likewise, for the boys, they can only have brothers, and as long as there are at least two boys, they can all consider each other as brothers.\n\n### Case Analysis\n\n1. **If \\( B = 1 \\)**:\n   - Here, there will be \\( G = 4 \\). The single boy would not have any brothers, as he would be the only one. Therefore, this case violates the condition.\n\n2. **If \\( B = 2 \\)**:\n   - This leads to \\( G = 3 \\). The two boys can be considered brothers. However, the girls would still only have the two boys as their brothers. Each girl will have at least one brother under this configuration. So, this case satisfies the conditions. \n\n3. **If \\( B = 3 \\)**:\n   - This results in \\( G = 2 \\). The three boys will certainly have brothers, and the girls also have brothers (three boys). This satisfies the condition.\n\n4. **If \\( B = 4 \\)**:\n   - This means \\( G = 1 \\). The four boys have brothers, and the single girl has brothers as well. This condition is satisfied.\n\n5. **If \\( B = 5 \\)**:\n   - This configuration would mean that there are no girls at all. Each boy would have several brothers, but the requirement regarding girls does not apply since they only need to have brothers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that when \\( B = 2 \\), both conditions are satisfied where each child has at least one brother and the minimum number of boys is achieved. \n\nThus, the minimum number of boys in the family is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

In this case, it seems like there is likely a text file named `file.txt` based on the decoded file name in the input.\n\nIf you would like to read its contents directly, you can modify the code to read the text file immediately after extracting:\n\n```python\n# Read and print the contents of the extracted file\nfor file_name in extracted_files:\n    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n        content = file.read()\n        print(content)\n```\n\nMake sure you have the necessary permissions to create files in the directory where you run the code.
