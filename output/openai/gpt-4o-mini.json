    "question": "In a family of 5 children, each child has at least one brother. What is the minimum number of boys in the family?",
    "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to understand what is meant by each child having at least one brother. \n\nLet's define:\n- \\( B \\): the number of boys in the family\n- \\( G \\): the number of girls in the family\n\nWe know that the total number of children is 5, which gives us the equation:\n\\[\nB + G = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, since each child has at least one brother, for the girls to have at least one brother, there must be at least one boy. Likewise, for the boys, they can only have brothers, and as long as there are at least two boys, they can all consider each other as brothers.\n\n### Case Analysis\n\n1. **If \\( B = 1 \\)**:\n   - Here, there will be \\( G = 4 \\). The single boy would not have any brothers, as he would be the only one. Therefore, this case violates the condition.\n\n2. **If \\( B = 2 \\)**:\n   - This leads to \\( G = 3 \\). The two boys can be considered brothers. However, the girls would still only have the two boys as their brothers. Each girl will have at least one brother under this configuration. So, this case satisfies the conditions. \n\n3. **If \\( B = 3 \\)**:\n   - This results in \\( G = 2 \\). The three boys will certainly have brothers, and the girls also have brothers (three boys). This satisfies the condition.\n\n4. **If \\( B = 4 \\)**:\n   - This means \\( G = 1 \\). The four boys have brothers, and the single girl has brothers as well. This condition is satisfied.\n\n5. **If \\( B = 5 \\)**:\n   - This configuration would mean that there are no girls at all. Each boy would have several brothers, but the requirement regarding girls does not apply since they only need to have brothers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that when \\( B = 2 \\), both conditions are satisfied where each child has at least one brother and the minimum number of boys is achieved. \n\nThus, the minimum number of boys in the family is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

However, if you're in a hurry or have heavy items to carry, it might be more convenient to drive. \n\nConsider the following:\n- **Time:** How much time do you have? \n- **Weather:** Is it raining or too hot outside? \n- **Convenience:** Do you prefer to relax in the car, or do you want the exercise?\n- **Car Situation:** Is your car already dirty, and is it practical to walk with it being a short distance?\n\nIf it’s just 100 meters, many people would choose to walk.",

You could try the following methods:\n\n1. **Unscrew or Remove the Seal:** If the seal at the top is designed to be removed, see if it can be easily opened or unscrewed. \n\n2. **Use a Straw:** If the cup's design allows for it, you could potentially use a straw to sip the contents from the bottom, assuming the contents remain contained above the bottom opening.\n\n3. **Tilt the Cup:** If the seal is somewhat flexible, you could try tilting the cup so that the liquid can flow toward the open bottom, but this may cause spilling.\n\n4. **Cut or Pierce the Seal:** As a last resort, if you don't mind altering the cup, you could carefully cut or pierce the seal to create an opening for drinking.\n\nIf none of these options are feasible, then it may be best to ask your friend about the intention behind the cup's design.",
