    "answer": "Great question. In standard tic-tac-toe, rotating the board \\(90^\\circ\\) changes **nothing fundamental**:\n\n- **Rules:** unchanged (still 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n- **Game state value:** unchanged (a winning/losing/drawing position stays that way under rotation).\n- **Strategy:** unchanged in substance—only the labels of squares move.\n\nSo if a move is “best” in one orientation, the correspondingly rotated square is best in the rotated board.\n\nExample:\n- “Take the center” is still optimal.\n- “Take a corner” is still symmetric across all corners.\n- Edge/corner tactics are identical after rotation.\n\nIn game theory terms, tic-tac-toe is symmetric under 90° rotations, so rotation is just a **relabeling** of positions, not a new game.",
