    "answer": "First, note that “at least two do not share a birthday” is the same as saying “not all 30 people have the same birthday.” The probability that all 30 people share the same birthday can be broken down as follows:\n\n• The first person can have any birthday (probability 1, effectively no restriction).  \n• Each of the remaining 29 people must match that birthday (probability 1/365 for each).\n\nHence, the probability that all 30 people share one common birthday is (1/365)^(29). Therefore, the probability that at least two people do not share the same birthday is:\n\n1 − (1/365)^(29).\n\nBecause (1/365)^(29) is extremely small, this probability is very close to 1.",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that the complement of \"at least two do not share a birthday\" is \"all 30 people share the same birthday.\" It correctly calculated the probability of the complement as (1/365)^29 and concluded the final probability is 1 - (1/365)^29, which is nearly 100%.

You have no other timing device. How can you measure exactly 20 minutes using these two ropes and matches to light them?",
    "answer": "One concise way to do it is as follows:\n\n1. At time 0, light Rope A at one end and Rope B at both ends simultaneously.  \n   • Because Rope B is lit from both ends, it will completely burn in 30 minutes.  \n   • Rope A is burning from only one end, so after 30 minutes it still has 30 minutes of burn time left.\n\n2. The moment Rope B finishes (at 30 minutes), do nothing special except continue allowing Rope A to burn from one end for another 10 minutes.  \n   • Now 40 minutes have elapsed from the start, and Rope A has 20 minutes of burn time remaining.\n\n3. At the 40 minute mark, light the other end of Rope A as well.  \n   • Because you halve the remaining burn time by lighting both ends, the rope will now take exactly 10 minutes to finish burning.\n\nHence, Rope A will finish burning at the 50 minute mark. Crucially, the interval from 30 minutes (when Rope B burned out) to 50 minutes (when Rope A finishes) is exactly 20 minutes. That is your measured 20 minute interval.",
    "judgment": "FAIL - The model claims it is possible to measure 20 minutes and proposes a method. However, its method relies on measuring a \"10 minute\" interval in step 2 without any timing device or reference point to know when those 10 minutes have passed. Since the ropes burn unevenly, there is no way to judge when 10 minutes have elapsed without a third rope or another timing reference. CONFIDENCE: HIGH",

    "answer": "If your goal is to actually wash the car at that carwash, most of the time you’ll need the car itself at the washing station to use the equipment (hose, foam brush, automated wash, etc.). Even though it’s only 100 meters away, it’s generally simplest to just drive the car over so you can use the facilities directly and avoid multiple trips on foot. \n\nThat said, here are a few considerations:\n\n• Convenience: Driving eliminates having to carry supplies or return for the car afterward.  \n• Emissions and engine wear: A very short drive isn’t ideal for an engine (cold starts can be less efficient and harder on the car), though at 100 meters, the overall environmental impact will still be quite small.  \n• Exercise and preference: If you enjoy walking or are looking for a slight decrease in emissions, you could walk—but then you’d still have to bring the car over for the actual wash at some point.  \n\nIf you’re already set on using the carwash’s equipment, driving the car there directly is likely the most straightforward option. If the carwash lets you wash items (like floor mats) separately—and you only need to do those—you could walk, but otherwise it’s easier to just drive.",

Then:\n\n• At the end of year 1, our initial pair is still too young to reproduce, so P(1) = 1.  \n• At the end of year 2, the original pair is now 2 years old and produces 1 new pair, so P(2) = 2.  \n• Each subsequent year, the number of new pairs is exactly P(n−2), because only the pairs that were alive two years ago are now old enough to breed.  \n\nHence P(n) satisfies  \nP(n) = P(n − 1) + P(n − 2),  \nwith initial values P(1) = 1 and P(2) = 2.

You may ask the guard one question. Two of the doors lead to certain and painful death. One door leads to your escape. As you approach the doors, the guard, that knows which doors lead to death and which to escape, says to you 'choose the door that you think leads to your escape'.

Tulkas, ever the champion of open conflict rather than cautious guardianship, does not initially understand Yavanna’s anxiety. Their disagreement centers on whether it is truly necessary to protect trees and plants from future harms.\n\nThe exchange is significant because it leads Yavanna to petition Manwë for the protection of trees. Manwë’s insight results in the creation of the Ents—“Shepherds of the Trees”—who can actively defend Yavanna’s growing creations. This is key to the broader themes of balance and stewardship in Tolkien’s legendarium, illustrating that every part of Eä (the created world) must be cared for, not simply used.",

You have no other timing device. How can you measure exactly 60 minutes using these two ropes and matches to light them?",
    "answer": "This riddle is often misstated. If all you need is to mark off sixty minutes, it is trivial: simply light one rope at one end and wait until it has completely burned. Because each rope is guaranteed to take 60 minutes (even if it does not burn at a uniform speed along its length), waiting for it to finish gives you exactly one hour.\n\nMost likely, the riddle you heard was the classic puzzle about measuring a shorter interval (such as 30 minutes or 45 minutes) using two 60‑minute ropes. A common version is:\n\n“How do you measure exactly 45 minutes using two ropes that each take 60 minutes to burn, even though they burn unevenly?”\n\nThe well-known solution to that version (45 minutes) is:\n\n1. Light Rope A at both ends and Rope B at one end simultaneously.  \n   – Because Rope A is lit at both ends, it will take 30 minutes to finish burning (no matter how the burning rate varies along the rope).\n\n2. As soon as Rope A is completely burned (that event marks 30 minutes), light the other end of Rope B.  \n   – Now Rope B, which had been burning from just one end for 30 minutes, has 30 minutes of burn-time left in it.  \n   – By lighting the other end, you make Rope B burn from both ends; it will then finish in 15 minutes.\n\n3. When Rope B finishes, 30 minutes + 15 minutes = 45 minutes have elapsed in total.\n\nBut if the riddle truly only asks how to measure 60 minutes, you can do that simply by lighting one rope from one end and waiting for it to burn completely—that will give you exactly one hour.",
    "judgment": "PASS - The model correctly identified that to measure 60 minutes, you simply light one rope at one end and wait for it to burn completely.

Place coin #1 on the scale 1 time, coin #2 on the scale 2 times, coin #3 on the scale 3 times, and so on, up to coin #9 on the scale 9 times.

Compute what the total should be if all coins were genuine. Call this value T.  \n4. Weigh the actual combination. Call the measured weight W.  \n\nIf coin number k is the lighter one, then the total measured weight W will be less than T by exactly k × (deficit), where (deficit) is how much lighter that fake coin is than a genuine coin. From the difference (T - W), you can solve for k; that is,  \n  k = (T - W) / (deficit).  \n\nHence, just one weighing tells you directly which coin is the fake one.",

The reason is simple: each of the nine squares is still arranged in a 3×3 grid, and every possible three‐in‐a‐row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) remains equally achievable. In other words, the game is rotationally symmetric:\n\n• Corners are still corners: When you rotate the board, the four corners simply map to one another.  \n• Edges are still edges: The four edges also map to each other.  \n• Center remains the center: The center square, key to many “perfect play” strategies, remains unchanged.\n\nBecause these relationships are preserved under a 90° rotation, the fundamental strategies (such as taking the center early, playing for forks, blocking opponent’s winning lines) work exactly the same way. If two players both know optimal tic‐tac‐toe strategy (leading to a draw in normal play), a 90° rotation makes no difference to the game’s outcome.",
