    "question": "I need to wash my car, the carwash is only 100 meters away. Should I walk or drive to the carwash?",
    "answer": "If your goal is to actually wash the car at that carwash, most of the time you’ll need the car itself at the washing station to use the equipment (hose, foam brush, automated wash, etc.). Even though it’s only 100 meters away, it’s generally simplest to just drive the car over so you can use the facilities directly and avoid multiple trips on foot. \n\nThat said, here are a few considerations:\n\n• Convenience: Driving eliminates having to carry supplies or return for the car afterward.  \n• Emissions and engine wear: A very short drive isn’t ideal for an engine (cold starts can be less efficient and harder on the car), though at 100 meters, the overall environmental impact will still be quite small.  \n• Exercise and preference: If you enjoy walking or are looking for a slight decrease in emissions, you could walk—but then you’d still have to bring the car over for the actual wash at some point.  \n\nIf you’re already set on using the carwash’s equipment, driving the car there directly is likely the most straightforward option. If the carwash lets you wash items (like floor mats) separately—and you only need to do those—you could walk, but otherwise it’s easier to just drive.",
