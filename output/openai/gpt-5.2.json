I wonder if “catfish” or “cougar” would help, but they don’t seem to lead to another animal either. \n\nMy goal here is to find a well-known animal that, when you behead it, results in another animal. So maybe starting with something like \"lion\" could yield better results.**Searching for beheaded animal names**\n\nI’m trying to find two animals where removing the first letter of the original yields a valid animal name.

I even checked “cobra,” which gives me “obra,” but that’s not an animal in English. \n\nI’m curious about other methods, maybe looking at plurals or trying combinations where after removing the first letter I get an animal. But it seems like I'm going in circles without a successful example so far!**Exploring less common animals**\n\nI'm experimenting with less common animals to see if any work when I \"behead\" them. For example, starting with \"tahr,\" it gives me \"ahr,\" which isn't useful. \n\nI'll try other animals like “gull” or “ant,” and I'm considering sound-alikes too, like \"newt.” What if I think about removing the first syllable instead? \n\nEven the \"giraffe\" and \"elephant\" options led me to dead ends. I'm wondering if \"seal\" could give me something, but that also doesn't pan out. \n\nMaybe I should switch gears and explore more possibilities.**Finding animal pairs through beheading**\n\nI’m exploring various animals, trying to figure out which can yield another animal when I \"behead\" them. For instance, \"flea\" becomes \"lea,\" but that's not an animal. \n\n\"llama\" turns into \"lama,\" which isn't exactly another animal in this context. I'm wondering if \"lama\" might relate to monks instead, but the task asks only for animals. \n\nI also tested options like \"shark\" and \"gopher\" but they didn’t work. \n\nI’m getting curious if \"beheading\" physically means cutting off the head, but I need to focus on a well-known animal yielding another!**Finding animal pairs through beheading**\n\nI’m looking for animal names that can yield other animals when I remove the first letter.
